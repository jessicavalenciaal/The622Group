2023-02-20,1676879835,"Really Emotional Week","The campus shooting at MSU on Monday night took place a mile from my house. I previously lived in Los Angeles for 20 years, so police activity is familiar to me, but the sirens and helicopters were relentless. MSU was my father's alma mater (he died in September on opening day of football season), and I grew up riding bikes to games with him. I never felt personally unsafe, but my heart ached for the students, and it felt like an assault on my childhood and my father's memory. Saturday my alma mater played his in basketball and I rooted for his team over mine, despite our teams being bitter in-state rivals. I signed up for a grief class at a local church. I took the same class after my grandfather's death and my cousin's suicide, but it's time to take it again. I cared for him in my childhood home before moving him into memory care, and now I'm going through it all over again with my mother. I just had to move my mother into memory care in December. I'm an only child and the only reason I'm in Michigan is because my (divorced) parents need me. I don't want to be back here. I miss my old life.","GriefSupport",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/11713cd/really_emotional_week/"

2023-02-06,1675693079,"Chaos Space Marine Legionaries - Iron Warriors","**A simple question for the day - are Iron Warrior Legionaries a solid enough unit to build around?** 

I think they could now be on par with Noise Marines, but that may be a controversial take!

* Chaos Space Marine Legionaries are an all-purpose obsec unit which can be kitted out to be all melee, all shooting, or a hybrid of both. 
* They are also one of the few units that can take a Mark of Chaos and an Icon for the full benefit. 
* With the latest points update, you get free upgrades on the unit bar the balefire tome. 

Iron Warriors supplement the Legionaries further with:

1. The Iron Warriors legion trait provides a good durability boost against -1/-2 AP weapons. In addition the legion trait takes away cover save bonuses and hit modifiers from dense cover. 
2. Good stratagems such as Dour Duty (*-1 dmg*), Spiteful Endurance (*5+++ FNP vs Mortal*s) and Cold-Hearted Malignity (*auto-pass morale+boost to hit rolls for remainder of the game*). 
3. The Warlord Trait Implacable Taskmaster provides a 6'' aura of counting as having remained stationary. This means you can stock up on some Legionaries heavy weapons and still move up the field without penalty.

I think this all combines to make Iron Warriors Legionaries a viable build around. For example, a simple comparison is:

* 2 MSU Noise Marine Squads with Blastmaster, Icon and a Power Fist = 270 pts. 
* 3 MSU Legionnaire Squads with Reaper Chaincannon, Icon, Power Fist and a Heavy Chainaxe = 270pts. 

Now of course, you have to invest 1 CP into a Warlord Trait and the Legionaries are less effective vs heavier targets. However, it is not a bad comparison in my mind as Noise Marines are (were?) considered a great unit. You could of course also double down on the flexibility of Legionaries by taking the Mark of Tzeentch and bumping the squad up to 10 models for the extra heavy weapon or some Khorne Units. 

I love Iron Warriors and the idea of taking a load of Legionaries seems fluffy and possibly...good?","WarhammerCompetitive",54,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/10v7p8u/chaos_space_marine_legionaries_iron_warriors/"

How can I get back to working again?","Im finally starting to work regularly again for the first time since I became chronically ill (undiagnosed autoimmune disease). Im still sick, just slightly less so& and whatever I have makes my adhd 100x worse and more resistant to treatment.

Trying to compensate for being unproductive for so long, I overdid it last week. I worked two 9-5 days in a row, had late night meetings, and was able to work every day (even if I couldnt do a full day).

I felt *so proud of myself* for being able to work at all. After so long accomplishing nothing at all, I was even able to overcome that all-or-nothing mindset of needing to do things perfectly or not at all. I just slowly, steadily, and consistently worked all week and it felt AMAZING.

##Unfortunately, all week, I was working on the wrong project.

My weekly meeting with my boss was painful. Not only did I double book our *reoccurring meeting* (and had to reschedule after receiving a chiding email), but I also had zero updates to give her. 

She was understandably disappointed and frustrated. I mean, its been a year of barely working and the *one* week I finally have both energy and focus, I do the wrong thing. Thanks, ADHD.

My boss basically told me to shit or get off the pot in terms of my work- though she said it in much nicer and more professional terms.

She wasnt wrong about any of it. I seem to have reached the end of her usually generous understanding, and Im angry at myself for letting it come this far.

Trying to prove myself, I told her Id have some things done by our 9am meeting on Monday (tomorrow). But I was burnt out from working so much last week, causing my symptoms to flare. And since my boss has only ever been kind and understanding, my Rejection Sensitivity Disorder (RSD) has been a beast: From the moment our meeting ended, Ive been feeling an undercurrent of dread and anxiety when I think about working.

Getting this emotional hit after feeling proud of myself for the first time in so long was really destabilizing, and now the stakes of not working are even higher.

Every time I try to work, I become so anxious that my executive dysfunction completely paralyzes me- I sit just here, unmoving, yelling at myself to do things, and feeling more and more anxious as I continue to do nothing. Thinking of one thing that I need to do triggers my mind to think of *everything* I need to do, and it all becomes impossible. 

Its like a raging hurricane kicks up in my mind just because I looked at my laptop and considered checking my email >&<û@

On top of all this, my symptoms are still flaring, Im about to start PMSing, and Im feeling hella funky from trying to switch to a new antidepressant.

Im so screwed, and Im just sitting here on Reddit, watching the minutes grow to hours, feeling tomorrows meeting getting closer like a growing nausea.

Does anyone have a way to escape from in this endless feedback loop of executive dysfunction loop and anxiety?

Has anyone else had this happen after getting yelled at by someone you wanted to be proud of you?

Update: I know this is a small post with little attention, but I needed to write this update. Trigger warning: &gt;!gun violence, death!&lt;

I work as a graduate student at MSU, and my two projects in this post were my Teaching work and my Research work. Last week, I focused all of my energy on teaching instead of research.

&gt;!Monday night, a student in my course was killed in the shooting at MSU. I dont directly teach her class section, but my section is filled with her friends- people who have grown with her for three years at MSU. My colleague who has taught her said she was an intelligent and amicable student.!&lt;

Everything is in such a different perspective now, you know? Im *really glad* I focused too much on my students last week. They had an exam on Friday, and those extra hours were put into helping them prepare for it. At least I was able to make the week before this horror a little easier.

That exam should have been one of the worst things about February for her. I remember telling my students that I hoped they all had a relaxing weekend after studying so hard for the exam. Did she get to rest before this happened? Did she get to celebrate getting through the exam?

All my worries feel so trivial now. And the landscape of teaching is going to be enmeshed with healing and finding ways to accommodate my traumatized and injured students. Maybe I wont focus as much on research as I should, but this *feels* more important, it feels right, RSD be damned.

My emotions are a bit all over the place, so Im going to be slow to reply to the lovely comments I got, but if any of you see this update, please know that I read and appreciate all of them!

This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!

Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.

 

Hello,

I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.   


The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.

Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.

If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.

We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.

I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.

Thank you,

2023-02-19,1676849825,"Which army/armies fit my playstyle?","I'm looking at taking a step back in 40k and actually taking the time to figure out what armies mesh well with my preferred playstyle, rather than pick something that looks cool only to find out that I don't like how it plays.  Using Table Top Simulator I can do this without having to spend money.

That being said, I'm having a hard time figuring out what armies to actually look at that match the way I approach the game.  Maybe some of the people here can help?

As far as my playstyle, I definitely prefer to lean towards melee than shooting; it seems to me and has been my experience thus far, that the game largely gets decided in the middle turns with melee combat, not shooting.  So ideally I'd like a melee focus with shooting done to supplement that; for example, tanks/vehicles should operate like assault guns or modern-day IFVs and be able to act in support of the infantry (melee) units.

I also like a combined arms approach within the framework outlined above, so I don't want like to double down on ONLY melee and not have anything to complement it.  I do NOT like hordes, but I like MSU with a slight nod toward more elite-style armies, with specialized units.  Probably most of all, since I have trouble wrapping my head around a lot of the game nuances, I need something that has a low-skill floor with enough of a skill ceiling that as I learn and grow, the army opens up more opportunities.  That is, the basic tactics are relatively straightforward, even ""simplistic"", and can get results just with that, but the breadth of the units opens up as you get better.

***TL;DR***

**Likes**: Combined arms with a melee focus (i.e. shooting and vehicles designed to support melee), MSU, low skill floor w/high skill ceiling

**Dislikes**: Hordes, high-skill floor

Are there a faction and list ideas that can fit those criteria?  I figure that once I can narrow down a faction to look at, I can explore the unit choices in depth and see what's available (for example, I'd like to avoid Firstborn units for Space Marines as I'm pretty confident that they're going to be put into Legends in the near future, maybe as early as 10th edition)","WarhammerCompetitive",61,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/116rmk7/which_armyarmies_fit_my_playstyle/"

Congratulations again! Like last year, **YOU created the safest Winter Carnival in 31 years!** You Huskied UP and listened to our advice. You looked out for each other. You protected the Husky Pack. 

**A ROUGH PAST COUPLE WEEKS**

The past couple of weeks have been rough on many of us for different reasons (e.g., exams, loss of loved ones, health, MSU mass shooting, and even a difficult decision I needed to make regarding a speaker invited to campus by a student organization). HuskyUP"" means kindness, listening, respect, caring, family, sense of belonging, civility, and community&and we have to embrace all these values even when we express different, unpopular, or controversial viewpoints.**SPRING BREAK IS HERE**We can all use a spring break which is coming up. Spring Break is a time when administrators tend to worry the most about students. **As you enjoy Spring Break, were gonna need you to HuskyUP"" and make safe, healthy, responsible, and mature choices.** Whether you are surfing on a beach, cruising on a ship, partying with friends, catching up with buddies, binge-watching movies, fellowshipping with people from your faith, or volunteering, stay safe.

**SPRING BREAK CHECKLIST**

* Keep valuables such as ID cards secure. *Please dont get stuck somewhere without your ID. We cant come get you.*
* Please, please let your parents, guardians, or loved ones know youre safe at least 3x. *No matter what you say, we* *still* *worry about you and always will!*
* Dont travel alone. Whos your travel buddy? Who got your 6? *People up to no good are less likely to mess with people in groups.*
* Dont lose your phone (in fact, just back it up right now on that cloud thing). 
* Dont rush. Allow yourself time to travel. *Rushing can lead to accidents.*
* Eat and sleep well. *Stop laughing - this is important to your health and wellness.* 
* Dont give in to peer pressure. *Real friends support,* *not* *pressure.* 
* Make sure someone else has your emergency contact information.  

**OKAY, LET THE MEMES BEGIN**

As your Dean of Huskies, it would be irresponsible to avoid some of the biggest concerns about spring break: the drinking, the partying, and those intimate encounters. *Yep, I was a college student too!* I also recognize that many of you will not be drinking, partying, or doing that *other* thing (*can you see my thankful hands?*).

* **Partying**. The Deans rules: Party in groups. Watch those hands. Dont put cups down in strange places. Remember stranger danger?
* **Intimate encounters**. Yup, I care, so Im going there. Nationally, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) may increase after spring break which is why I encourage #connectonadeeperlevel (talking and getting to know each other as people).

* **Confessions of spring breakers**. You can read stories [here](https://projectknow.com/discover/confessions-of-a-spring-breaker/) about what students wish they had not done.
* **Alcohol and other drugs: Know what you put in your body**

   * Dont mix [alcohol ](https://www.mtu.edu/well-being/for-students/self-help-resources/substance-use-resources/alcohol-use/)and other substances
   * If you choose to drink, alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks
   * If you feel the effects of your drink are stronger than in the past, tell your buddy 
   * The effects of edibles ([cannabis](https://www.mtu.edu/well-being/for-students/self-help-resources/substance-use-resources/cannabis/)) may take longer than you think (90+ minutes)
   * THC levels in cannabis can be dangerously high - be aware of those levels if you choose to consume
   * Have a designated driver or sober companion

For starters 2nd years do not even have class at the vet school but in the med school and they make sure we do not feel welcomed.

They are refusing to let us have zoom classes (despite using zoom to record lecture) even though students have voiced feeling uneasy and unsafe being in campus.

I was just told not to go to the dean because she has more important things to worry about then her students. You only have 1 large animal rotations during clinics of which is primarily equine. If you want to do food animal you will be given little to no lectures on them. I completely regret my decision to go here and I am not the only one who feels this way. A stress survey was sent out (completely made by a student with no help for faculty) after many of us voiced concerns. The average stress level of 2nd years was 7.8 on a scale of 1-10. Nothing was done and faculty basically said there was nothing they could do. Mind you the wellness coordinator nor the dean knew about the survey til after the fact. Therapist have emailed the school saying something needs to be done for the students mental health and they wont even get a reply. They are faculty members accussed of sexual assault who are still working with students with no punishment. Please do not go here if you care about your mental health.","veterinaryschool",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinaryschool/comments/11ei823/do_not_go_to_michigan_state_vet_school/"

Hello,

My name is xxxxxxxxx. As a xx year old rural farm living American Democrat, I have absolutely no interest in any new gun legislation in Michigan. This recent shooting at MSU is an absolute tragedy but passing knee jerk legislation will actually be a disservice to the victims. The perpetrators father gave an interview and went on and on about how his son's mental health had slowly declined and he had become more and more erratic. I want you to be the bold representative who addresses the root of the problem with mass violence and suggests stronger mental health facilities and mental healthcare access in Michigan. As we look across the country we see many mass shootings and mass violence but the thing at the root of all of them is a metal health issue. Look at the shooting in Buffalo New York, the perpetrator of that crime apologized in court and wishes that they had had a mental health intervention or program that could have helped them before they killed those people. Putting roadblocks in the way of someone getting a gun is just delaying the inevitable if someone is determined to cause harm. Taking a proactive mental healthcare approach will stop individuals from wanting to cause harm in the first place. In Waukesha Wi a man used a car as a weapon to kill parade goers by running them over. Access to firearms wasn't an issue here but mental health interventions at some point in this man's life surely would have helped. This is the common thread that ties all of these horrible occurrences together. Access and availability of firearms has decreased with every law that is passed but it does nothing to stem the problem. The shooter in the Oxford highschool shooting was in the school councilors office with a piece of paper that showed how in distress this young man was. Nobody wants to say that the mental health system miserably failed this young child and could have prevented this terrible tragedy. Multiple gun laws were broken that day in Oxford but none of them including new ones that are being discussed now would have stopped someone intent on causing harm. What may stop it in the future would be mental health interventions at the appropriate time. I truly believe that new gun legislation will do nothing to stop mass casualty events, it will only serve to criminalize otherwise law abiding citizens. Please take a step back and really look at what solutions  will help with the problem of mass violence and try to implement those. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I look forward to a reply.

The list:

Discolord

2*10 Warptalons

MoP

1-2 rhino

1 obliterator

2-3 Havoc

LOTS OF MSU LEGIONNAIRES

The gameplan:

I&amp;S can deny enemy primary, pairs nicely with BEL and AL scout move strat imo.

Buff warptalons survivability with MoP and jam onto enemy DZ in turn 1, tagging shooting threat + moveblocking melee, score BEL.

Turn 2 do AL secondary with whats left (ah hopefully) with fall back and action warptalons and if theres little left then drop the obliterator in to fullfill secondary.

Turn 3 onward do skirmish with havoc, Legionaries and rhino forcing opponent to go wide. I can pull Legionaries into reserve and drop back in if i needed.

I will probably get tabled every game but i will dedicate every brain cell of mine to deny enemy secondaries and primary.

2023-02-16,1676565381,"PSA: Alternative Gas Supplier solicitors/scammers","Yesterday afternoon, I was visited by a salesperson claiming to be ""auditing"" for Consumer's Energy and asking about my natural gas bill. I foolishly decided to let the guy see my most recent bill and signed some papers after he said he could lower my gas cost recovery rates from $6.26 per MCF to around $5.89 per MCF. The guy never said what company he worked for (made it sound like he was with Consumer's), never gave me his name, and he never said anything about what he was actually doing, which was signing me up to change my natural gas supplier from Consumer's Energy to Ardent Natural Gas LLC (the same logo as the one on his badge) without my full knowledge and/or consent. 

After feeling uneasy about what I did today at work, I started looking around online and realized what I had fallen for. Tons and tons of reports that Ardent has scammed people into signing contracts with them, promising lower prices, and then immediately jacking up their rates because their company only offers fixed rates for the first month and are not regulated by the MPSC so they can do whatever they want. There have also been tons of reports that they will try to charge you $100 to terminate your ""contract"" with them. 

I immediately called Consumer's Energy (800-477-5050) and requested that my account be locked and for them to deny any requested gas supplier changes for my address. It took them a couple of minutes to do so, but they got it done and promised that any attempts at changing my gas supplier would be denied. If they came to your place recently and you also fell for their scam, I highly recommend that you contact Consumer's Energy and do the same. 

The fact that they are trying to scam people like this is upsetting, but what makes things worse is that they are actively attempting to target survivors of a mass shooting (my apartment is right across the street from campus) less than two days after the event occurred. They knew what they were doing. They knew that we're more likely to fall for this scam when we were at our lowest. They are actively preying on the vulnerable, which is downright atrocious.

I will be filing complaints with the AG's office, writing scathing reviews on google and the BBB, and will likely file a police report just in case. If anyone else has any suggestions for things I can do to try and help stop them from doing this to more people, please let me know. I do not have any pictures of the contract, nor do I have pictures or recordings of the salesperson. 

If they show up to your door, either keep it closed or open it to tell them off and then close it. Don't be like me. Don't show them your energy bill. Don't let them in your house. Do your research before signing anything. 

This is not me saying that you shouldn't consider getting an alternative gas supplier. This is me saying that you should stay the hell away from Ardent Natural Gas LLC.

I'm on meds so I don't hear voices too often nowadays but he called me right after and I told him I love him and that I was just hearing his voice in my head and it seemed like telepathy.

I wish we had reasonable gun laws, but we dont. At what point is the rational decision to keep hoping and praying for gun control but also start carrying a gun of my own? 

For context, I have no military or law enforcement background. I have absolutely no desire to shoot another person. I would only ever consider pulling a weapon in a kill or be killed situation. I have never had a ccw or felt the need to carry a weapon in town. I am among many other things a hunter, I do carry a handgun in the woods in certain areas at certain times of year. I also keep my guns unloaded and locked up the rest of the year. I practice regularly, and Im not going to the Olympics, but I can breeze through any law enforcement shooting qualification test in the US(air marshal test is hard). After one too many mountain lion encounters I do carry a handgun during archery and muzzle loader hunting seasons. Any other time I count on making enough noise to scare off unwanted wildlife encounters.

    Created with Warhammer Age of Sigmar: The App

General game plan:

* deployment:
   * screen the ironblaster with the mawpot + frost sabres on a home objective
   * deploy kragnos and the stonehorn further forward, with the stonehorn sideways
   * put the three tyrants behind the stonehorn so they're screened from charges and protected from shooting by the new 'key to victory' rule
   * icebrow can either sit by the mawpot / help screen the ironblaster, or stay in reserve if useful for the battleplan
* rest of game:
   * icebrow puts keening gale on kragnos so it keeps up with the stonehorn
   * if not attempting turn 1 charges, 'leadership of the alpha' can be used to auto-run the tyrants so they keep up (exactly) with the stonehorn, otherwise save it for a triple all-out-attack
   * charge with the stonehorn and tyrants and enjoy big impact mortals on 4+ and 3+
   * use the new stonehorn monstrous action to fight something squishy if there's space in the back
   * charge with kragnos, especially fun if you roll high on impact ability vs monsters
   * take long cannonball shots with the ironblaster, and creep forwards (with frost sabres) to stay in range; if enemies get close and charge, unleash hell hail shot can hurt them a lot
   * icebrow is flexible, can move up and keep boosting movement, hang back and apply a 6+ ward to the ironblaster for counter shooting, or come in as a reinforcement to capture a side objective
   * don't forget to use the triumph (if you have it) to re-roll a key charge, especially if low on CP when the icebrow is in reserve

Changes and alternative options:

* I actually ran 'flask of stonehorn blood' and 'fuelled by ghurish rage' on the second and third tyrants, but found these pretty lacklustre for survivability, and usually ended up charging with them before activating either. The gryph feather tyrant *always* survived much longer, so I've swapped in amulet of destiny, and leadership of the alpha since it synergises really well with three tyrants. Another alternative would be tunnel master on the icebrow, so it can stay on the board for early prayers but also do some sneaky later game objective captures.
* You can add another tyrant if you swap the stonehorn for MSU mournfang, adopting a similar strategy of using them to screen the tyrants. I chose the stonehorn version because the monstrous action is great, and it's a nice distraction carnifex to keep the tyrants alive if nothing else. Also, if you don't care about (or prefer) high drops, with another tyrant you can get another 'magnificent'.
* You could also replace the stonehorn with gluttons for a slower march up the board, and a big triumph bid. Impact mortals would be on 4+ for either, but gluttons risk that dropping if they take casualties, and can't do the cool monstrous action, but will probably do more damage in melee once they arrive.
* One fun thing this list can't do is the new mortal wound spell, so it could be fun to take an arcane tome or swap a tyrant for a natural wizard.

If you decide to play the list (or a variant) I hope you have as much fun as I did - this post is already pretty long so I'll stop here, but if anyone is interested in a breakdown of my games I'd be happy to follow up.","Mawtribes",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Mawtribes/comments/10w3c3n/meme_list_for_new_ghb_meatfist_tyrants_kragnos/"

Well, MSU was shot at last week, as a result my school (that is also in Michigan) had a moment of silence that lasted about 4 seconds and it made me so angry. 

Half-assed moments of silence do not stop school shootings, nor does it help those affected. Regular mental health checks with students stop school shootings. Actually making an attempt to stop bullying instead of just saying you have a ""zero tolerance policy"" stops school shootings. Taking shooting drills seriously stop school shootings. The government is doing nothing to help us so it is time for the schools to step in.

I am seriously so frustrated because I know that if I voiced this opinion to the school they'd label me a delinquent and give me a few detentions for calling them out. We're clearly not getting gun laws or mental health care or livable wages anytime soon so it's time for the students and schools to step up. I could go on and on but it's truly disheartening that we have to risk our lives at school everyday and no one is doing anything to help.

2023-02-15,1676474721,"What little we know about the MSU shooting","There's not much we know definitively about Anthony McRae, the guy who attacked Michigan State University. However, we know he was previously charged with multiple felonies related to carrying a firearm without a license, although those were pled down to misdemeanors. There is also reliable reporting that police frequently received reports of negligent/reckless discharge from his neighborhood, as he often fired his guns out of his back door for target practice. Regardless, he purchased the two handguns he likely used for this attack legally, because he had no felony convictions.

I'm torn. Someone who knowingly violates firearm laws and discharges firearms inside a neighborhood is clearly reckless and gives the gun owner community a bad name. Even if many of us might argue that constitutional carry should be the norm, I think we would all agree that knowingly violating concealed carry laws (unless you're deliberately trying to be a test case for a constitutional challenge) is irresponsible gun ownership. But when does irresponsibility, recklessness, and outright illegal conduct become so serious that we would want the person to be restricted?

In a number of states, the ability to obtain a concealed carry license can be a defense to unlicensed carry anyway, so is this really even the fault of the prosecutor for accepting a misdemeanor plea instead of going for the felony charge?

I don't necessarily think that the solution is tighter imposed restrictions, but it might make sense for prosecutors and courts and legislatures to start promoting voluntary restrictions. E.g., ""You've been charged with a felony crime that is either violent in nature or involves firearms. If convicted, you would be a felon and permanently lose your second amendment rights. However, this is your first offense and the prisons are overcrowded, so we will give you a misdemeanor plea deal on the condition that you agree to a court order that you don't purchase, possess, or use firearms for five years. Deal?""

On Monday night, February 13th,  a  43 year old suspect, Anthony Dwayne McRae caused the passing of three promising college students of Michigan State University.  There was a four hour manhunt for the suspect while students sheltered in place. 

It was a devastating and chaotic night. Quickly, campus police, various levels of law enforcement officers, emergency workers and others arrived to the scene. A tip from a caller led police to find the suspect. 

Anthony Dwayne McRae passed away from a self-inflicted weapon wound as law enforcement were closing in on him. He lived only a few miles away from the University campus. 

There are five wounded students who were taken to the hospital. So far, they havent been identified. 

Anthony McRaes uncle admitted that he suffered from Paranoid Schizophrenia.

Anthony McCrae was not taking medications nor receiving treatment for his illness. Possibly his motive was the effect of him feeling mistreated by businesses. He did not feel valued.

When presented with trauma we should be proactive right? Turn helplessness into action? What about trauma that can keep happening at any time?

Ive been trying to figure out school with my toddler. Shes 3. Its paralyzing me. We are in Michigan. And now some of the kids who survived ortonville were right back in it at msu. So two school shootings theyve had to survive. Within 14 months.

Im not afraid of the anxiety Ill have to deal with. Im afraid for her trauma even if nothing happens- shell be put through drills in kindergarten even. At that age kids cant separate pretend from reality- thats not something I want for her. 

I can keep her home but would that mess her up? Im an educator and can make sure she has whatever she needs but I know she needs more than me. Do I risk her life and mental health or do I risk stunting her growth/ confidence/ etc? At least keeping her home I can see where Im insufficient and get help. Social activities, physical growth and challenges& but will she be missing something else? Am I being selfish or tactical?

Seeing the fucking news report on Grammys outfits and spy balloons. Seeing the news reports of rising inflation. Seeing the billion dollar profits being handed to oil companies and plastic polluters and other corporations that are destroying the world. I read a book last summer about how the United States and Europe have been complicit and intentional in their destruction of the global south, and I still can't stop thinking about it when I see the US military invading the middle east and playing their cards close to their chest with Ukraine, and when I think about how millions of people in the world are being exploited all of the time. And more exploited than anyone is the fucking rainforest and the waterways and the air we all breathe. 

I'm part of the generation that had school shooting drills, and was always convinced we'd be the victims of the next Sandy Hook. I lost a classmate to a gun related accident in middle school. I had an anxiety disorder my entire life. Vicious panic attacks until my body trained itself to dissociate. And I'm no stranger to violence myself. I'm a sexual trauma survivor and I was physically abused for over a year. One time a guy came over and he asked why I sleep with my desk lamp on. In reality I feel so unsafe all the time that I sleep with the bedroom door locked too. 

I don't know how we're supposed to cope with this. And why are we even supposed to carry on normally knowing that someone could take an AR-15 to my university library and get through the doors no fucking problem and probably make it through to the doors on the other side without anything stopping them. It's so unsecured. It just counts on us hoping and praying I guess that we're not MSU.

He posted a $5,000 bond and the case was ""bound over"" to a different circuit court and ""closed"" on 6/27/2019.

I can find no record of the case in the other circuit and there's nothing to indicate that the bond was ever returned.

What was the outcome?

Was he legally able to buy a gun?  If so, why?  If not, how did he get one?

Of note, I also found multiple traffic offenses including being a repeat offender for driving without a license.  But the main issue is the weapons violation.

In short, this is NOT a ""law abiding gun owner.""  But we knew that.

And, of course, the shootings took place in a ""Gun Free Zone"" as it's now come out that the shootings were inside the buildings and we have at least one photo of him entering a building while drawing the handgun.  One can't legally carry inside an MSU building even if holding a valid permit.

**UPDATE** [Found his prison record](https://mdocweb.state.mi.us/otis2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=606937)

Apparently it the charge was lowered to a misdemeanor - ~~meaning he was NOT a prohibited possessor for THIS charge.~~

**EDIT**  ~~He was a prohibited possessor. The misdemeanor charge has a potential penalty of ""not more than 2 years"" which means that he's a prohibited possessor under 18 USC 922(d)(1)~~

**EDIT Again**

I forgot about 18 USC 921(20)(b) which says

&gt; crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year does not include

&gt; any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.

So, he MAY not have been a prohibited possessor.  The statute lists the crime he was convicted of as a ""misdemeanor.""  However, I'm finding anomalies in MI law such that a ""misdemeanor"" with a penalty of up to 2 years is also a ""Class G Felony.""  If the evaluation is on the statute saying ""misdemeanor"" on it then 921(20)(b) means he is **NOT** a prohibited possessor.  But if it's considered a ""felony"" then 921(20)(b) doesn't come into play and the crime is punishable by a sentence exceeding one year so he is a prohibited possessor.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused; but leaning towards him not being a prohibited possessor on the concealed without a permit charge that he plead guilty to.","gunpolitics",73,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1126k3x/msu_shooter_prior_arrest_felony_concealed_carry/"

We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State

While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.

I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.

Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane

Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.

Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.

More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.

Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State

Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.

While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.

In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty

Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.

The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.

Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford

This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.

There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.

Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State

These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.

Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.

During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State

Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.

When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.

However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland

I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.

Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.

With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA

I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.

We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.

I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota

Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.

Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.

During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State

I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.

The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.

Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia

This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.

After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.

Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin

Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.

Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.

In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee

A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.

And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.

In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State

While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.

After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.

On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina

A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season

**Team: New England Patriots**  
Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  
Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18

Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.

Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.

This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.

Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story

Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 

The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 

This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.

Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 

Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs. 

***

#Three Quick Questions

**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**

The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.

**What the hell happened with the coaches?**

All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  
&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him

This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.

The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 

So why Patricia? Well, he was available.

**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**

Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 

Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers

Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.

**Three cheers for...**  
*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*

These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.

You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.

**Three jeers for...**  
*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*

Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.

And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  

The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.

##Highlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 

**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.

##Lowlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.

**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 

Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*

##2022 NFL Draft Recap

**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**

**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.

**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**

**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**

**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.

**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**

**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete

**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete


The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward. 

**2022 draft grade-right now (B+)**
***
#2022 Free Agent Review  

##Notable Additions

**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.

**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.

**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.

**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.


##Departures

**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.

**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.

**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.

**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.

**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.

**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.

**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)

Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.

Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.

*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 

Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  


I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)


In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 


Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles. With Harris struggling to stay healthy, and having his carries cut nearly in half [(202 in 2021 to 106 in 2022)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3925347/damien-harris), Rhamondre took the helm as workhorse for the team. Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.


In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.


All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 

While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*  

##Roster Review  
Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.

##Quarterbacks

**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  

Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.

Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.
***
##Running Backs

**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.

**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.

**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.

**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.

**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.

**Damien Harris** UFA
***
##Wide Receivers

**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.

**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.

**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.

**Nelson Agholor** UFA

**Jakobi Meyers** UFA

**Matthew Slater** Re-signed

**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.

**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.

**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.

**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.

**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.

*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.
***
##Tight Ends

**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.

**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.

**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.

*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.
***
##Offensive Line

**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.

**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.

**James Ferentz** UFA

**Yodny Cajuste** RFA

**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.

**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.

**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.

**Marcus Cannon** UFA

*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).

**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.

Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 
***
##Defensive Line 

**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.

**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.

**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.

**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.

**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.
***
##Defensive Ends

**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.

**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.

**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.

*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)
***
##Linebackers and Defensive backs

Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.

Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

2023-02-22,1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 

\-Going back to work.

The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 

\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.

From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 

\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.

In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 

However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.

The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 

This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.

\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest

With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 

Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 

I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 

I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

2023-02-22,1677044568,"Mental Health Resources","Hey guys, I hope youre all doing as well as possible, given the circumstances.

I have been having a hard time and ended up using a lot of the mental health resources MSU has provided. I was very nervous about using them, not knowing what to expect with each, so I thought Id share my experiences with them here. I figure if writing this helps one other Spartan, its worth it. Everything Ive used and more can be found at [https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/)

Grouped by degree of interaction, since that was the hardest part for me, then ranked within each group by order of helpfulness to me personally (YMMV):

**1. No interaction**

* Short Webpage: [Managing Your Distress After a Tragic Event](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/distress_students/index.html)
   * **10/10 start here**. **If you do nothing else, give this a read.**
* [Spartan Resilience Training Program Reflect and Connect Sessions](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/reflect_connect_feb13.html)
   * Cannot recommend signing up for one of these sessions enough. Extremely helpful.
   * You do not have to turn on your camera and there are no breakout rooms. You can participate in the Zoom chat as much or as little as you'd like.
   * For MSU faculty, staff and graduate students - focus is on normalizing the range of reactions right now, and how to help yourself so that you can be there for your students, supervisees, etc.
   * You need to sign up for a session to get the Zoom link.
* Online recording of MSU Webinar: [Developing Resilience in the Wake of Tragedy](https://vimeo.com/799997473/226de731e9)
   * I found it helpful for basic starting information on what is normal to be experiencing right now, answers to the immediate what do I do questions, and an idea of how to start moving forward. Theres also a Q &amp; A at the end with student questions, and it was reassuring to hear other Spartans ask about difficulties Im having as well.
   * CW: Some of the student questions at the end briefly mention where they were on campus and their experience.
* [Uwill Self-Guided Tutorial Videos](https://app.uwill.com/)
   * Free if you sign up with your MSU email
   * Short guided meditation, breathing exercise, and yoga videos.
   * Nothing specific to trauma, but potentially helpful for relaxation and sleep.
   * ADHD gang and anyone else struggling with slowness/stillness right now may find moving meditation more helpful, which isnt on here.

**2. Text-only interaction (anonymous &amp; available 24/7)**

* [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline)
   * You text with a trained counselor about how youre feeling and whatever difficulties or concerns youre having. Like a normal text conversation, it takes them a few minutes to reply sometimes, and it doesnt feel as personal as talking to someone on the phone or IRL.
   * They consider mass shootings a type of disaster and so the counselors refer to last week as a disaster which felt a little odd at first, but otherwise it was helpful to me, particularly for talking about survivors guilt, nightmares, and that sort of thing.
   * They noticeably use some pre-generated messages where they fit, but this isnt because the counselor youre chatting with is disingenuous, just that there are a limited number of volunteers, so they save time by having frequently repeated messages handy to copy and paste. If anything, it means a lot of other people have needed to know/hear the same thing, which is reassuring in its own way.
* [988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/)
   * While suicide is in the name, this service is for anyone in emotional distress.
   * You text with a trained crisis counselor about how youre feeling. They listen, reassure, and help you figure out what you can do to feel a little bit better in the moment. The goal of the conversation is to get you out of that feeling of acute distress, so felt most helpful to text when I was feeling awful, like after a vivid nightmare.
   * At the start of the chat, they ask you to rank how distressed you are and if youre having thoughts of ending your life. If youre not in imminent danger, you may wait a bit to be connected with a counselor.
   * This one was hit or miss for me. Ive used it twice now, and one person I spoke with was incredibly kind and helpful, like talking to a wise older sibling that really cares. The other felt much less authentic, and I didnt find particularly helpful.
* There are a lot of other text helplines, I just havent tried them. [You can find a list on this page if you scroll down and click ""Text, Phone and Hotline Resources""](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/index.html)

**3. Zoom interaction**

* [Finding a long term therapist on ThrivingCampus](https://msu.thrivingcampus.com)
   * **The most helpful thing for me has been finding a therapist to work with via ThrivingCampus.** I saw them on Zoom, but some therapists offer IRL appointments as well (says on their profiles).
   * Lets you filter by identity, practice area, insurance, types of issues they work with, and other factors. If you select available for crisis response in the filtering sidebar on the left, youll only get therapists who have specifically signed up to be available in the aftermath of incidents like this.
   * Pros: I was able to find someone to start seeing that week from the same fairly small identity group as me. The sessions are about an hour long (exact length depends on the therapist and your insurance), which allowed a lot more time to get into things vs just skim the surface.
   * Cons: It is normal therapy like if you found them on Google, so while the website to find them is free, the sessions cost money. How much will depend on your insurance. There is a section at the top left to filter by therapists offering limited free sessions, but I did not try that and don't know how it works.
* [Uwill 1-on-1 teletherapy](https://app.uwill.com/)
   * Free 30 min Zoom session with a licensed therapist - just need to sign up with your MSU email.
   * Pros: you get to pick the therapist. The one I spoke with was an MSU alum and very nice.
   * Cons: 30 min goes by quickly. It helps to make a list ahead of time if there are questions or topics you want to make sure to get to.
   * After your first session, you have the option to schedule more free Zoom sessions, or you can do them on the phone, via text, or by email. Personally, Ive found being able to send an email to the therapist I spoke with really helpful just to have someone Im not as worried about judging me to tell how a tough day went and get some support and suggestions. They reply within 24 hours.

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.

Some people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.

I watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped themselves, at the end.

### Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State

While Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State. Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion for the next names up.

I thought throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes, and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three  although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball through a big hit.

Obviously Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown, including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day. However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly on multiple occasions.

### Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane

Unless youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked 1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over 1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the Year.

Spears was the biggest winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut schemes the second practice.

More importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden, where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched the ball during full team period.

Still, Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

### Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State

Now combining the running back position and the school I started with in Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021, Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team All-Mountain West accolades.

While his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he simply didnt lose many reps.

In team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions. That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards) early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

### Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty

Just a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish, losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the air as the next four players combined.

The first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one, because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a window for the ball to arrive.

Douglas made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was voted the WR of the Week for that side.

### Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford

This guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again big-time during Senior Bowl week.

There were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running. Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back to the QB.

Along with the way he was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline, after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action, where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

### Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State

These all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular. Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards in each of them.

Day one, this guy kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on. Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by DBs untouched basically.

During team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro, he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually during those drills.

### Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State

Now, on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11 passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.

When you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple of steps on the DB.

However, hed also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the 16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

### Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland

I had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all but three of his final 42 games.

Athleticism was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback. His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never lined up at Maryland.

With that being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order to create movement in the run game on top of that.

### Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA

I had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C. States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league coaches.

We had a lot of powerful interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones, and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was able to ride that guy past the QB.

I dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos, to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340 pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that, he was named the West IOL of the Week.

### Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota

Its not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the country this past season.

Everything this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once looping around towards the center.

During team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each, and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one of them.

### Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State

I really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall, Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier, but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for 33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes batted down at the line.

The question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at 342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.

Watching him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

### Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia

This has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to first-team all-conference the latter two years.

After lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give him ground.

Yet, Stills mightve been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him, to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through, trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting another one on the last defensive play for the East.

### Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin

Unlike the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned. Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10) and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.

Since I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.

In run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display, winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside. Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his effort chasing away from the play.

### Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee

A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer to an early day three prospect.

And what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage. During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck for the interception.

In team run drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his hands, to slither around them.

### Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State

While I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety, outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.

After showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside, you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two, once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.

On top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen  not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly. Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine invite.

### Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina

A position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two sacks across his two seasons there.

WASCO, Ore.  Forensic DNA sequencing has helped give a name back to the skeleton found by the John Day River in 1989, said the Oregon State Police.

On March 26, 1989, the remains of a body were found on the Sherman County side of the John Day River. The Sheriff's Office recovered the incomplete skeletal remains, which included long bones and a skull with dental work.

Nothing was initially known about the possible identity of the deceased, despite local interest. The bones were taken to the Oregon State Medical Examiners Office (SMEO) for examination.

The examination determined the deceased had most likely been a white male in his 40s or 50s\*, around 5'6"" - 5'9"" tall. Dental work on the skull's teeth was also noted for identification purposes.

The Sheriffs Office received multiple tips on the possible identity of the deceased, with many people believing the remains were David West Jr., a man who disappeared trying to cross the John Day River during a flood in 1964. They reported that West Jr. often crossed the river to feed cattle, and had even created a makeshift cable car to help get over the water. On the day of the flood, the cable car was found washed away, and West, Jr. was never seen again.

In 1989, West, Jr.'s dentist was consulted with the evidence gathered from the skull's teeth, but no conclusion was reached.

The SMEO submitted a bone sample to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification in 2010, and a sample of forensic DNA was uploaded into a database. However, there were no genetic matches in that database.

In April 2022, the SMEO ""recognized the effectiveness of investigative genetic genealogy on cold unidentified remains cases,"" and the forensic DNA sample was given to Othram, a lab specializing in advanced forensic DNA testing. Othram's genome sequencing revealed the names of two biological relatives of David West Jr. as being genetically connected to the bone samples.

Those family members were contacted and gave cheek swabs for further testing.

The genetic link was confirmed by DNA comparison in September 2022, and the family was notified of the positive identification.

&gt;I guess the level of enjoyment you get out of Hogwarts Legacy depends on your knowledge of the Harry Potter universe. The more you love this world the more youll enjoy Hogwarts Legacy. Its as simple as that. This doesnt mean that theres nothing here for those who are just getting started with Harry Potter or just want a fantasy world to explore - there certainly is - but Hogwarts Legacy truly feels like a love letter to the fans of J.K Rowlings work, above all.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is the game I've always dreamed of. I never thought you could do something like this with the Harry Potter saga. Avalanche has dared to create something new, but still being faithful to the original material. We are talking about one of those problematic games because not only do they overshadow everything that has been done with the franchise in the past, but because the next title will have a very difficult time reaching the bar that has set this one. Hogwarts Legacy is the game every Harry Potter fan deserved; a work for which I was not prepared.

&gt;While it doesn't do everything perfectly, Hogwarts Legacy stimulates the imagination with a rich world to explore and gameplay that empowers and thrills the player. The Harry Potter films had the tough task of taking words on a page and creating a visual language for them. Hogwarts Legacy had the even tougher task of taking that visual language and making it interactive, ultimately expanding it all into something that is fun to play and immerse yourself in. Although there's still a long year ahead of us and tons of great looking games on the horizon, Hogwarts Legacy is already one of the best games of 2023.

&gt;While technically competent in all ways, the reliance on nostalgia and old ""don't-fix-it-if-it-ain't-broke"" game mechanics keeps Hogwarts Legacy from really being as stellar as it could be.

&gt;If you're already a Harry Potter fan, there will certainly be something for you at Hogwarts Legacy, even with a completely different range of characters from the one you're used to. The music, the different classrooms, the ghosts wandering around, the paintings on the walls, the poltergeist Peeves, it's all so nostalgic that, for a moment, I returned to my adolescence. If you're not entirely familiar with the Harry Potter lore, it'll be a little harder to understand some of the game's mechanics, but don't worry: you still have a huge world to explore, dozens of puzzles, collectibles and creatures to capture. Who knows, your journey into the world of sorcery begins here!

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a fully fleshed action RPG with everything that belongs to that. The fights are fun, the magic based riddles are nice, the presentation is beautiful, even if the game does not deliver a technically through and through next-gen experience. Don't think so much about the open world, think more about a magical atmosphere, that should reach any RPG player, in particular fans of the Harry Potter franchise.

&gt;Avalanche Software and Portkey Games have done an impressive job of creating something original within a much-loved franchise. Hogwarts Legacy is the closest any of us are ever going to get to actually attending Hogwarts, and what a magical experience it is. Its clear that its been created with love, and the attention to detail here is phenomenal. Its not without its issues, of course, but theres few that get in the way of the overall experience. It looks gorgeous, its a joy to play, and being a wizard is just about as fun as wed always hoped it would be.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a solid first attempt. If Avalanche can be accused of anything, it's that the studio has tried to do too much all at once.

&gt;Expecto Verdictum! Hogwarts Legacy offers a serious mystery story that could quickly form the basis for another book in the Harry Potter world. It also often provides humorous situations that aren't just fan service. At the same time, it is not a fairy tale. The story isn't afraid to be morbid and doesn't hide the fact that the wizarding world is full of danger. The game manages to captivate as much as it disappoints but in a balanced way. It works well, thankfully, offering plenty of entertaining content that doesn't just act as filler between the main missions.

&gt;Pushing the J.K. Rowling controversy to the side, Hogwarts Legacy is a true celebration of the magical universe that she created which perfectly transitioned to film. Her universe has equally been adapted well into this game courtesy of Avalanche Studios with its gameplay and story.

We'll meet a few Weasleys, even a gaunt, to name a few. The only known characters from the other formats you'll know are the ghosts of Hogwarts, with you crossing with Peeves, chatting with Nearly-Headless Nick (if you're Gryffindor, I assume other houses will be different) and other longer-term fixtures. Fortunately, and as far as I am, the game manages to forge its path incredibly well, adding in a few canonical elements, such as ancient magic. I'm not at the end, so if it is canon, I'm curious how they explain away the lack of ancient magic in later stories.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is the most definitively accurate and exciting wizarding world adventure people could hope to experience, short of getting a real-life invitation to Hogwarts. With hours of content and a wealth of wizarding wonderment, you'd be hard pressed not to enjoy yourself to an impressive capacity.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy borrows a lot of design choices and ideas from other open-world titles, and yet, it creates a truly unique product, unlike any title in the genre, with a true focus on world-building rather than non-stop combat encounters. Its a game that should be experienced, even by those who arent Potter fans at all.

2023-02-26,1677444357,"Was there a secret black population that ruled Korea and Japan? (No)","https://twitter.com/BayemyBiyick/status/1521493044272549888?s=20

This is the first time I've heard of this idea. Bayemy Biyick's book was shared with me under a video about Japanese history, and I had to take a look. Looking into how this theory is described, it's complete nonsense.

&gt;For several centuries, the Japansese welcomed millions of African refugees who were victims of genocide.

This is simply improbable. Later they mention that the supposed Black rulers of Japan were displaced by the 7th century. Considering that the estimated population of Japan in the year 700 was 5M (according to Jean-Noël Biraben in *Demography: Analysis and Synthesis: A Treatise in Population*, Vol. 3, part 1, chapter 66, page 13), we'd expect genetic markers to exist in today's Japanese people had ""millions of African refugees"" been welcomed into the country. [A paper by Osada and Kawai](https://doi.org/10.1537/ase.201215) investigating the genetic history of Japanese people corroborates the 'dual-structure' model of migration to Japan. Osada and Kawai state: ""the dual-structure model, the present-day Japanese population consists of two different genetic layers, which correspond to indigenous Jomon hunter-gatherers and rice-farming Yayoi migrants."" The Yayoi migrants correspond to the time period in which these African refugees would have moved to Japan--but genetically, the Yayoi people are linked to Korean and Southeast Asian populations (Osada et. al.), and archeologically, the southwest Korean peninsula.

&gt;As a distinctive and partly-African state, Kudara was organized around science and self-improvement.

The name ""Kudara"" is strange. It comes from the romanticization of Japanese name for the kingdom of Baekjae, ~ß. It's odd to choose this pronunciation, because in Hanja, ""Baekjae"" is written the same--~ß--and is pronounced... ""Baekjae"". Kudara==Baekjae, and I'm not sure why this choice was made. That would be like calling China Jungguk instead of ZhMngguó. I can't assess their claim of a society organized around science and self-improvement.

&gt;In 313 AD, by driving out the Han (Chinese) colonists from the [Liaodong] peninsula, the people of Koguryo (North Koreans) became the first military power in Asia.

Starts strong, but only gets worse. Yes, Goguryeo conqured the Liaodong peninsula in 313 AD. No, Han is not synonymous with Chinese (esp. at this period of time), and neither is Goguryeo with ""North Korean"". As for the assertion that they became the first military power in Asia, that's just wrong. I don't see how this connects to ""Kudara"", anyways.

&gt;From the 3rd century AD, Kudara peacefully civilized all of Asia through culture, science, and trade.

That's a broad claim to make for a country that also supposedly was destroyed and whitewashed from history.

&gt;In 371 AD Kudara conquered the giant Koguryo kingdom, becoming the first military power in Asia.

? I thought the first military power in Asia was Koguryo? Perhaps they mean ""first"" as in ""preeminent"". In any case, it's just wrong. Goguryeo did suffer a military defeat and lost territory to Baekjae/""Kudara"" in 371 [(source)](https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;pg=PA37), but the dynasty would last for several hundred more years--they weren't ""conquered"".

&gt;Koguryo (North Koreans) rejected the traditions of the Han (Chinese) and adopted the African scientific civilization of Kudara.

&gt;As early as 371 AD, Kudara built 9 engineering universities in Pyongyang, capital of Koguryo.

The earliest recorded higher learning institution in Korea was the ÜY (Taehak), but little is known about it. What is known comes from the 12th Century *Samguk Sagi*, where [it is written](https://ko.wikisource.org/wiki/%EC%82%BC%EA%B5%AD%EC%82%AC%EA%B8%B0/%EA%B6%8C18/%EC%86%8C%EC%88%98%EB%A6%BC%EC%99%95): t m æûcÊn`S [Ï cû å¢¹i Ë'xN²P. This just merely references the possible existence of a university in that time, and in no way suggests that ""as early as 371 AD, Kudara built 9 engineering universities in Pyongyang"".

&gt;China was founded in 581 AD by the Han tribes after the genocide of Black peoples living between Mongolia and the eastern Yellow Sea.

The only thing right here was that a Han-led Chinese dynasty that would unify China (the Sui dynasty) was founded in 581 AD. Picking 581 AD for the foundation of China is a strange date, considering that the Sui dynasty was short lived and didn't represent the same cultural and political upheaval that other dynastic transitions came with. The genocide aspect here is too broad of a claim to make in one breath; I don't know how to evaluate this beyond ""there is no evidence for the massive genocide of Black peoples in China prior to 581 AD"".

&gt;Silk, a high-tech industry, was developed, mastered and monopolized by African in Asia until the mass genocides.

This is unlikely. The proposed Black migration to East Asia occurred for several centuries prior to the genocides and overthrow of Black rulers and people in the 6th and 7th centuries. Silk production has been documented [as early as 8,500 years ago](https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0168042), well outside of this timeline.

&gt;Kudara people are the inventors and owners of the writing system currently used in South and North Korea.

Hangul? Possibly the language system with the most documentation as to its creation? Given that we have primary sources written by the person credited with creating the language, the [Hunminjeongeum](https://web.archive.org/web/20051014020418/http://www.hangul.or.kr/M2-4-1.htm) and its associated commentary, [the Hunminjongum Haerye](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231071307/http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Hunminjongum/hun/p01.htm), it's hard to believe that anyone but King Sejong could have invented it. On the contrary, there is no evidence that Black Koreans associated with Baekjae invented the language system implemented by a Joseon king nearly a millennium later.

&gt;King Sejong is, by far, the most honest regent in Korean history.

&gt;In the 14th century AD, China gave Korea all the scientific and cultural heritage stolen from the Kudara people 800 years earlier.

? Huh? I don't know what this is referring to. As a side note, if they had all this stolen advanced scientific and cultural heritage, why did the Chinese not apply this information themselves?

&gt;King Sejong of Korea abandoned neo-Confucianism, converted to African spirituality and had a temple built in his palace.

I have no clue what this is referring to. I'm guessing parallels are being drawn between Korean shamanism and African spirituality, but those are very distinct belief systems. As far as I'm aware, there's no temple he built dedicated to African spirituality.

&gt;It took nearly 300 years to erase the Shilla culture and impose on the Koreans, by force and law, African culture and traditions.

Who is doing the erasing? ""Kudara"", a seperate polity that doesn't exist at this point? Goryeo, a Buddhist nation that is known for their production of valuable historical records (eg. the Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa) that are absent of mentions of Black Koreans?

&gt;Until the 7th century AD, the empresses of Japan were African and descended from the founding clans.

[Here's a contemporary portrait of Empress Suiko, who reigned from 593  628 as Empress regnant.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Empress_Suiko_painting.png)

&gt;The 1953 armistice terms of the Korean War took into account the existence of Kudara, the historic Middle Kingdom.

As far as I can tell, it didn't. The portions of the [Chinese copy](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7062613?objectPanel=transcription) of the armistice agreement that have been transcribed show no matches for the text, and the [English copy](https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/ac/rls/or/2004/31006.htm) makes no mention of ""Kudara"". It wouldn't make sense for the term ""Kudara"" to be used anyways, since that's a Japanese term, and the Japanese weren't the ones negotiating the armistice.

&gt;The North and South Koreans are as brothers as the Finns and the Congolese.

Genetic data (such as that summarized in the plot in Osada et. al.) show close genetic proximity of all Koreans. Korean families in particular have been great at keeping ancestral records, which allow different the origin and movement of different family names to be tracked. Additionally, Korean culture has emphasized marrying outside the clan. Both of these facts result in a traceable ancestry that aligns with intermingling between South and North Koreans prior to the modern era. (No sources for this one but based on my own family experience. My family originally came from China, settled in North Korea, and my close ancestors moved to the southern part of South Korea. I can directly trace North Koreans and South Koreans marrying into my family.)

&gt;Rooted in Asia for at least 3,000 years, racism and ideological and visceral hatred of Black people inspired ideologists and mass criminals in Europe.

???? I have no response to this. That's a broad assertion.

&gt;Who thought, organized, carried out the genocide of more than 20 million Black people in Kudara, and more than 1 billion Blacks in Asia?

The sudden genocide of 1.020 billion people would have most certainly left behind archeological, cultural, genetic, and linguistic evidence. Where is it?

&gt;Erased form histoory by China, the history of the victims of the genocides in Asia was encrypted and inscribed in nature and on a continental scale.

It had been a test observed by all officials, admirals, generals, any person of importance in that empire was there. Some barren world in some backwater corner of that empire was selected. 

A team of fifteen soldiers landed on the surface of the barren world, and between four of them was the bomb. A sleek black case with four metallic handles, large and cumbersome. The point of this test was to see if the destructive potential was there. The ergonomics could come later. 

Fifteen were selected, each a specialist in explosives. If even the smallest hitch occurred, those generals and admirals needed to be sure it could be resolved on-site. They placed the case on the ground carefully. Very carefully. One of the soldiers crouched next to it, pressed a few buttons on a small panel, and then they quickly retreated to their ship and left the surface. They had forty-five minutes to get out of dodge.

Plenty of time, provided nothing goes wrong. Nothing went wrong. Those officials sat in the flagship of their navy, a large window looking down on that world. Sipping champagne and enjoying the calm music from a live band, they talked and talked and talked about budgets, strategy, and voting habits. 

A voice rang out over the intercom of the ship. ""Killamjaro test fire set to detonate in one minute."" Those same officials put down their glasses and gathered around the window, still talking. ""T-minus 10"", that man on the intercom called out. Counting down, the officials hushed themselves.

Ten seconds went by. There was no sound in space, but those on the ship could swear they heard that planet groan. The spot on which the bomb was placed deformed inwards as if caving in on itself before the opposite side of the planet spat out fragments of its crust, the same then occurring on the original side of that world.

The other two sides of the world were now separated and fragmenting, splitting apart. A polite applause erupted on that observation deck. They were pleased. The galaxy was horrified. 

They had all heard this upstart race was working on something like this. It took them seventy years to make this. Their ships were primitive, the systems an inefficient mess. But this? This was a threat. Humanity had just assured its eternal independence. That bomb said, ""threaten us, threaten our homes, our lives, our family, and we will rip your world from under your feet.""

What was worse? It took them seventy years to destroy a world. How long until they supernova a star? How long until that gun at the head of the galaxy pointed at the universe? How long until they threatened the entirety of existence? A thousand years? A hundred? 

That... brings us to the current state of galactic politics. The United Galatic Council is outraged that they would make something like this. Sadly for them, their own rules forbade them from inviting humanity to this council, and so humanity was not beholden to their laws.

Humanity just exposed a flaw in the system. Humanity didn't care. They weren't in the system.

It didn't matter to them. They had the gun, and their history proved they were more than willing to pull that void-damned trigger.","HFY",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/10uto1w/with_baited_breath/"

2023-03-05,1677985839,"PSA: Most people get rejected or accepted to selective schools for completely arbitrary reasons","In light of ~~the upcoming purge~~  decision season, I thought I'd post an important reminder from my college counselor.

Beyond the basics like good grades, good test scores, good ECs and good essays, most decisions come down to truly stupid shit. Most applicants to super competitive colleges are up to snuff per their standards (see the statistic from Princeton about 80% of applicants being eligible for their school), so those final decisions come down to some things that are legitimately out of your control.

Geographic diversity, for example (sadly doesn't apply to internationals). Colleges like to have an incoming class with students from every state, and they might accept someone from underrepresented states, like Wyoming or South Dakota, simply because they make the incoming class more diverse.

They might also admit based on someone's major choice, even if the school isn't admitting by major. If a relatively unpopular major, like certain foreign language studies, needs a certain number of students just to keep existing, universities may go out of their way to admit students who select that major.

Unfortunately, income does play a role at every university, even if they are technically ""need blind""-  universities only have so much financial aid to give.

Extracurriculars and sports are also taken into account. If a university needs more people for their water polo team, they'll look for water polo players. If they need bassoons in their orchestra, they'll look for bassoon players.

And of course, whether they admit it or not, an admissions officer's personal tastes do somewhat leak into their decisions. They really might admit one student over another just because, for lack of a better word, they ""vibed""  with their essay better. Or maybe they reject you just because they were in a shitty mood when they read your app.

And this is just speculation, but I bet that towards the end of the admission season when AOs are making difficult final decisions, they sometimes do just choose qualified applicants at random (after they've chosen applicants to meet goals set by the development department of course).

So if you get rejected, just remember, it was probably completely out of your hands.

By Kelyn Soong
February 8, 2023 at 2:38 p.m. EST

https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/08/nike-vaporfly-super-shoe-running/

The Nike Vaporfly super shoe uses a new foam technology and has a carbon fiber plate, but a new study shows these perks may benefit faster runners more. (Video: Alexa Juliana Ard/The Washington Post)

So-called super shoes,"" which are high-tech sneakers that companies claim help wearers run faster, have taken over the running world. Professional and elite runners say the shoes have helped them break records, and amateur marathoners buy them in hopes of running a personal best.
Get the full experience.Choose your plan

One of the best-known super shoes on the market, the Nike Vaporfly line, can sell for $250 or more. Now a team of exercise scientists has authored a study that aimed to answer the question: Should average runners bother with these shoes?

Most of the research that had been done was on people and paces that would be relevant to people who were running like sub-three hour marathons, which is a really small fraction of runners, said Dustin Joubert, the studys lead author. And yet these shoes are marketed to everybody.
Running fast and slow

Super shoes typically have a lightweight, compliant and highly resilient midsole foam with a curved, rigid plate often made from carbon fiber embedded within the foam.

A shoe with just the foam is not quite super, and a shoe with just the plate is not super, said Geoff Burns, a co-author of the study. Together, theyre magic.

Or at least, it seemed that way. A Nike-funded study published in 2017 found that among 18 runners tested, the shoes improved running economy  the amount of oxygen required to cover a certain distance  by 4 percent on average. That study looked at running speeds ranging from 14 to 18 kilometers an hour  or runners who can sustain between a 5:22 to 6:54 mile pace.

An independent study published in 2022 by Joubert compared different brands of super shoes and found that the Nike Vaporfly improved running economy by about 2.7 percent at speeds of 16 kilometers an hour (or 6:02 mile pace) compared to a control shoe.

But Joubert, an assistant professor of kinesiology at St. Edwards University in Austin, hypothesized, based on case study testing on himself, that at slower speeds, the super shoes would not be as beneficial.

For the new study, the researchers tested 16 runners  eight women and eight men  at far slower paces than in the previous studies. These runners moved as fast as 12 kilometers an hour (an 8:03 mile pace) and as slow as 10 kilometers per hour (a 9:40 mile pace). (A four-hour marathon is a 9:09 mile pace.)

As in the earlier studies, the focus was running economy. Burns, a physiologist with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and an adjunct assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Michigan, describes running economy as ""very similar to your fuel economy in your car.

The runners completed one set of four repetitions of 5-minute trials on a treadmill, moving at the 10 km an hour pace followed by a similar set of repetitions at the 12 km an hour pace. There was a 5-minute break between each 5-minute trial.

Subjects wore either the $250 Nike ZoomX Vaporfly Next% 2, which represented super shoes, or the $90 ASICS Hyper Speed, which served as the control shoe representing a more traditional racing flat. Each runner ran twice in each shoe style, completing multiple reps at both paces.

The researchers found that the subjects improved their running economy by just a fraction  suggesting that the shoes do more for you, the faster you run. In the study, runners running at 9:40 mile pace improved their running economy by .9 percent, on average, while they improved by 1.6 percent at 8:03 mile pace.

Joubert also pointed out that five of the subjects did worse while wearing the super shoes. Their running economy was worse in the Vaporfly while running at the 10 kilometers per hour speed.

Nike didnt respond to a request for comment. The Washington Post reached an ASICS America spokesperson, who said the company did not want to comment on an independent study.

Burns speculated that average runners may not be maximizing the benefits of the foam at slower speeds. The faster and faster you run, the more force is put through the shoe, Burns said. At slower and slower speeds, you no longer fully compress it and youre not really using the full potential  literally and figuratively  energy of it.""

He also noted that the curved, carbon-fiber plate embedded in the foam of the shoe may not offer the same benefits at slower paces. There could also be a speed dependency to that plate,"" Burns said. And its possible the stiff plate may negatively impact a slower runner, he speculated: You need to have some level of speed threshold to kind of really not be working against the plate or fighting it.

Burns added that one limitation of the study is that the runners were all about the same size. Its possible that runners of different weights might produce a difference result.

Both Joubert and Burns said that they believe the results from this study would be applicable to super shoes by other brands.

If you dont like the shoe or get on with the shoes well, its not a guaranteed benefit, Joubert said.
A new study suggests that slower runners may benefit less from super shoes, like the Nike Vaporfly, than faster runners. (Video: Alexa Juliana Ard/The Washington Post)
A potential mental boost from super shoes

Wouter Hoogkamer, who conducted the 2017 study funded by Nike, called the new study very well-executed but said he found the results somewhat surprising."" The ASICS control shoe could have made a difference, he said. Hoogkamers study used a different control shoe.

I think at these slower speeds, the control shoe might be fine, said Hoogkamer, an assistant professor in kinesiology at the University of Massachusetts who was not involved in the recent study. So its not necessarily that the Vaporfly shoes are not as good; its more that the control shoe might be enough shoe to work well if youre not running that fast.

Lisa Levin, a Road Runners Club of America certified running coach, said she tells her clients to get fit for shoes at a specialty running shoe store and that the most important thing is that the shoes fit a runners biomechanics. Comfort is also important.

Because if you get injured or the shoe is hurting you or not a good shoe for you, it is definitely not going to make you faster,"" she said.

Levin added that sometimes, being in a super shoe can give runners a mental boost.

I would hate to say, This is only a shoe for fast people. That feels very elite,"" she said. ""But again, our concern as coaches is, dont just jump into a shoe that you dont even know is going to work for your biomechanics.

Joubert said the findings add to our understanding of the role of shoes in running performance, and shouldnt necessarily discourage slower runners from trying them. For some runners, the approximately 1 to 1.5 percent potential improvement in running economy might also be worth it.

The effects are still meaningful,"" he said. ""I think you might expect that theyre not going to get as large of a benefit as some folks running at faster speeds, but if you had the money and youre looking for a racing shoe, and you liked the feel of the shoe, I think you stand to have some benefit from it.","running",233,"https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/10xw30p/super_shoes_may_not_boost_average_runners_as_much/"

2023-03-02,1677756060,"AITA: said i didn't consider college fund a ""complete blessing""?","I (24F) went to university in the United States. I had a significant merit scholarship (20k/yr), an on-campus job, and a college fund, the direct contribution for my family was relatively low, and I didn't need to take out any loans.

The money in my college fund came from a hard time in my family. When I was 13, a family friend's daughter (like a cousin to me) died from cancer. Later that year, my grandmother (mom's mother) and uncle (mom's brother) both died very suddenly within two months of each other -- my grandmother was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and my uncle was found dead shortly after her memorial service.

That period lead to the breakdown of my parent's marriage. My dad never liked my uncle and would make comments like ""there's only so much you can do for people like that"", and my mom (who was very close with her brother) resents him for keeping my sister and I from having a closer relationship with him. My brother (then 11M) developed an eating disorder that still requires treatment and he has panic attacks if one of our parents calls her after midnight, because he thinks they would only call that late if someone else in our family had died. I had to grow up and look out for him while my mom was recovering, and I became the peacemaker/third parent. My grandmother and uncle left money to my sister and I for college in their wills, but I would have rather had them alive and have had to go to a less expensive college as a result.

Recently, one of my friends from college (24M) asked me if I had seen the news about the student loan repayment pause. I said I did, but I didn't know a lot about it because I didn't have loans. He then started asking me a lot of questions about my family's finances (my mom is currently working part-time, my dad is a teacher) and how I'd been able to go to college without loans. I didn't want to get into it, so I said I had a big scholarship and that my extended family had contributed a bit. He then got frustrated and started to complain about ""rich people who act poor but will never actually struggle"", fixating on the family contributions part. I tried to explain how I had actually gotten the money (it isn't like I have multimillionaire grandparents dispensing cash from their yacht in the Caribbean) and in my explanation I said I was obviously grateful, but I didn't consider it a ""complete blessing"" because of the huge impacts it had on me and my family. My friend got really upset at that and said I was trying to play ""oppression Olympics"" with him and that he was upset that I'd kept the ""truth"" about my family finances from him. He did have to take out a federal loan to go to college, but he also received federal grants and merit aid from the school

Why I may be the AH: getting the money was difficult and complicated, but doesn't change the fact that at the end of the day I graduated without loans, which is a luxury.","AmItheAsshole",118,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g0c3u/aita_said_i_didnt_consider_college_fund_a/"

Recently, our orientation/campus tours department for our university has stated they wanted to do summer orientations for FTIC and transfers. These will take place EVERY Tuesday and Thursday over summer, with advisors being forced to hold a session later in the day for anyone with questions about major requirements. 

The head of said organization emailed me, the chair, to thank our department for doing this with them (I love the presumption) and I said Hey, your org does great work, keep it up!

This is just absurd to me we have had nuclear Armageddon in the backs of the worlds minds for a long time now, also the threat of a virus outbreak, asteroid impact.. so many things in space could easily destroy our civilization, we are at the mercy of the cosmos. Since we discovered the earth wasn't the center of the universe we have continually been humbled and shown how small and insignificant we are.

Lue elizondo saying we may not be the top of the food chain is irrelevant due to the fact we already are low on the food chain speaking on a universe sized scale. I mean what's more important humans or black holes in the universe which far outlast our existence, they are far far bigger then our entire planet or sun and able to collapse physics and bend space-time. If a black hole was to somehow travel to us we would be less then plankton in a whales mouth. Since science has proven all this an believed the world has the right to know these things even if its scary or proves our universe is significantly more chaotic and dangerous then previously thought.

What revelation about some reality possibly imperceivable to us would cause such a moment many think would happen, telling us that we were artificially created? Being used for an experiment? That there is beings who could eat our soul, or something equally crazy? What about any of these would cause everyone collectively to view this issue through as lue elizondo put it ""somber"" lens?

Me personally? Nothing stated above, yes even the weird idea of something eating our soul wouldn't cause me to panic or cry or anything besides going about my life the same way I have been. It likely wont change your day to day, we will still have to get up go to work and deal with the same things we have been dealing with. Disclosure of any kind will not change our immediate lives our create some Zion like moment or even cause humanity to collectively come together on the issue, nearly everyone will have varying opinions or beliefs about facts stated by science. The world cannot hardly agree on what type of pancake is the best, much less all this supposed disclosure or truth so many people refer to.

# Volodymyr

[Detail of a painting of Hero of Ukraine Volodymyr Rybak by Beata Kurkul.](https://preview.redd.it/vunelumwu8ma1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5c0a86a0495004cc68eefd8df8b971d692664bdb)

**Volodymyr Rybak** was born and lived all his life in Horlivka, except for a few years when he was studying at university.  Originally he studied in a local community college and became a car mechanic, but then he put himself through law school.  Volodymyr loved his community.  He wanted it to be better for his family, neighbors - just for his fellow citizens - so he joined a political party and started on a path of civic activism.

In 2010, he was elected to the local city council.  He participated in Revolution of Dignity and was on Maidan during the scariest February days when the blood of Ukrainian patriots stained the cobblestones of Kyiv streets.  He told his friends, ""If I survive *these* days, I will live a long time.""  But it turned out differently.

He was successful as a miracle worker of local politics.  He had built a home for his wife and daughter, in which every nail was nailed by his own hands - and his career on the council was no different.  He demanded order and high standards.  He ensured that garbage was collected not once, but twice a week.  He even filed lawsuits so that local authorities worked harder and that the shelter for the homeless was improved; before long he had become known as an anti-corruption crusader.  Under his care, schools were repaired, and the kindergartens had unbroken windows again.

In other words, the incorruptible Volodymyr was a threat to ""russkiy mir"".

[Volodymyr with his wife and daughter.](https://preview.redd.it/wx1yt2tal8ma1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c25c884cabbf561ba7c5260588b98ab763be64bb)

After the regime of yanukovych fell and the puppet fled Ukraine to the cozy embrace of his master, russian thugs illegally crossed Ukraine's border en masse, sowing chaos and misery in Ukrainian towns and villages.  Despite the world spending years calling it a civil war and using coy terms like ""crisis"" and ""internal conflict,"" many of these thugs were ID-carrying members of FSB and other official agencies of the russian state, which has been confirmed time and time again by both Ukrainian and independent international sources.

These thugs organized well-staged fake riots and violently assaulted anyone who tried to stop them.  They tried to seize Ukrainian land under the pretense of manufactured social unrest, while clutching modern military hardware including grenades and machine guns.

Volodymyrs home of Horlivka in the Donetsk region fell victim to these terrorists.  Armed thugs came to his peaceful hometown, stormed the towns administration building and removed the Ukrainian flag.

[One of the last images of Volodymyr, during a confrontation at the Horlivka administration building.](https://preview.redd.it/zk9znngck8ma1.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eb7fcc1fbd8b9e213453b964e4707076f41a932c)

Volodymyr attempted to raise the Ukrainian flag over the Town Council building.  He was unarmed.  He was abducted by thugs, pushed into a waiting car.

This was the last day he was seen alive.  It was April 17th, 2014.

[The last known photo of Volodymyr as he is led away.](https://preview.redd.it/nsu6pplhq8ma1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a5f49a84f0fa4d4b08ec16ba430d626fc03011f6)

On April 19th, Volodymyr's body was discovered by local fishermen in the Kazennyi Torets River near the village of Raihorodok.  He was 42 years old.

Next to Volodymyr's, another body was found - that of a young man.

He was a student named **Yuriy Popravka,** and he was only 18.

According to a witness who was captured with Yuriy and survived the torture, Yuriy was killed for refusing to speak russian and for refusing to lie that he attends moscow Orthodox church services. The witness that lived did switch to russian language and said he is a follower of moscow Orthodox church.  We are not shaming the survivor by mentioning this, it is simply further evidence that Yuriy's killing was ideological in nature.

After his disappearance, when Yuriy moms called his phone, a mans voice answered the phone and simply told her, ""He is dead.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Both men had been tortured: they were mercilessly beaten with severe skull fractures, burned with fire, and stabbed.  They had been disemboweled, and sand was poured into them before they were dumped in the river.  According to forensic evidence, they were still alive as they drowned.

The man who interrogated and oversaw the torture and killing of Volodymyr and Yuriy is a moscow native and agent of FSB whose name I will not mention here.  A few months later he went on to oversee the shootdown of [MH17](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/w44lpa/510_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_148th_day_of/), which claimed the lives of 298 innocents.  He was asked about Volodymyr and Yuriy by a journalist in 2020, and he openly replied:

""Naturally, Rybak, as a person who actively opposed the militias, was an enemy in my eyes.  And his death, probably, is to some extent also under my responsibility.

Do I regret that they were killed?  No, they were enemies.""

He remains one of the most celebrated and popular russian influencers on social media today.

Its endearing to know that even after all this time theres still people following me and sending me heartwarming messages and comments. Also, thank you? To whomever reported me to RedditCare. I didnt even know that was a service they offered. It was, I hope, from a place of caring and concern. I guess at some point the story made it into tiktok? So hello to all of those who came from there.  At this point Im expecting aol chatrooms or yahoo answers were to show up.

The new 20s are kicking my ass and not in a particularly positive way, i cannot wait for this decade to be over. A redditor called my last update a holiday special and it made me laugh, i dont think they meant it kindly but it just struck me funny because i am an absolute sucker for the hallmark channel, so here I am again after the holidays.

For my haters (and those who dont wanna sit for a half hour monologue), heres the **TL;DR:** I got a robot mop, my basil died, things started to look somewhat normal, my ex-husband tried to kill himself, and now im back living at my parents.

Ive highlighted the bits mentioned in the TL;DR in case you want to skip to parts, but now for the longer version of events not necessarily  in chronological order:

**My life saving robot mop and my dying basil :**

At the suggestions of multiple redditors i got myself a steam mop at first. It definitely helped but I still had to go through the motions of mopping and the floor still being a little damp and my socks getting wet is what bothers me about mopping, so at the suggestion of other redditors i got a robot mop! I have a roomba i just didnt know they also made mop versions. Its perfect and i love it. I run her while im out for the day and i come home to nicely fresh dry floors and its the best feeling in the world.

My little basil plant died, i think its my fault because i moved it from where i had it in the kitchen and it was getting more light than before but its dead. I did make a really nice pasta salad with the last of it (orzo with cherry tomatoes, mozzarella balls, olive oil, salt and basil. Super simple and delicious). I was gifted a few miniature rose plants, thoroughly killed all of them in a few months and kinda gave up on live greenery.

**Life going back to somewhat normal and my internal monologuing ramblings:**

Life sucks and then you die. One of my sisters has always been attached to that saying and i think that the beauty of it is that it can be interpreted in so many different ways. She sees it as a reminder not to focus on the bad things for you never know when you will die, but right now i feel it a bit more literally. I believe the romanticized saying of when it rains, it pours comes from a similar sentiment.

I went on a date, a friend of mine set me up with a coworker of his and it was weird. I dont know if ive always been this awkward or if first dates as a rule are awkward or if we simply didnt click with each other but i just spent the entire dinner with this feeling of fight or flight? The guy was lovely, I dont know, maybe we shouldve just done something less formal than dinner? I havent had a first date in so many years. I guess people nowadays do coffee instead and I should have gone that way, or maybe i wasnt ready yet.

My new (not new anymore but the one i got after everything happened) job is lovely. My boss doesnt gift me flowers anymore. I dont know if hes  perceptive and saw what happened last year and got the hint or if someone mentioned something but now when everyone else gets flowers I get lamps. I know it sounds random but I love lamps and light up things. In the past year he has given me a little cat night light that brings me so much joy, also some fairy lights and one of those himalayan rock salt lamps. Hes a great guy and I really appreciate the effort.

My workmates are great and the work we do is both fun and fulfilling which is something I didn't have before. I used to have 2 jobs, one fulfilling and one to pay the bills. Its crazy to have one that does both and it makes me feel like I wasted so much time of my life in my previous one, so thats a silver lining of everything.

Tortilla is doing great, she now has to eat prescription food and is very unhappy about it even though its been months. The winter is always a little rough on her because she gets extra fluffy and you can tell it bothers her so tis the season for more brushing and deshedding. If you have long haired pets I do recommend the furminator but amazon has cheaper comparable alternatives. She is getting older so I do what I can to make sure shes comfortable. One of my sisters got a kitten and we watch him while shes out of town and Tortilla absolutely adores him. Matcha (the kitten) doesnt love all of the grooming she gives him and pretends not to like her but if shes asleep hell go and cuddle with her but if she wakes up first hell run away.

Im rambling perhaps because i dont know where to start or what to tell and Its also scary in a sense because i know certain people keep tabs on me through this account, and i dont care if they do but it still feels odd. Kinda like the feeling you get when you know someone is watching you from afar. I dont know if thatll make sense to you guys but yeah anyway.

When im feeling particularly masochistic ill read comments on places where the peeman saga has been shared, most of you on my own threads are absolutely lovely and supportive, but outside of my own virtual walls is where people share the harsher opinions. As I mentioned, its masochistic and unhealthy and I know it and my therapist knows it but it also grounds me a bit and helps me see things from perspectives i hadnt considered.

For example, someone called me deranged for being so obsessed over cats. I hadnt really noticed but a good portion of my updates do revolve around cats and cat wellbeing. This is because I, in fact, do love cats. That person said i showed more empathy towards cats than i did towards Ash or my family in law, or even Ted. and yeah, a little. Consider me sociopathic if youd like but domesticated animals in general do not have a say in what goes on in their lives, we as pet owners make the decisions for them and try to make the best ones that we can. But in regards to Sunny, yes, i absolutely and to this day will always feel more empathy for her than for anyone else involved because she was helpless, there was no other option for her, no safe place, and no one to advocate for her. Even if you take out the sentimental component and my attachment to cats, from a humane standpoint it was still awful and there is a reason why animal cruelty charges were considered.

Other comments said i was over victimizing myself, that what i went through was truly nothing and im just dramatic (which maybe i am a little) and that the true victims were x or y or z. I think each person involved in this whole ordeal is a victim in one way or another, but being a victim in your own story does not trump you being a villain in someone elses. Take my ex-mil for example, she is the person who has gotten the least amount of sympathy in everything ive read but her husband was a pos, he was an abusive father and husband, i know her upbringing was less than stellar and has a lot of unresolved trauma with the death of her daughters. Does it excuse her behavior? No. Does it explain it a little bit? Maybe. Does it make better all of the damage she caused? Definitely no.

Ash was a victim of an incredibly abusive childhood, but part of the reason why this caught everyone by surprise and why everything went downhill so fast is because he was very well put together, or at least he was incredible at managing or hiding away his feelings. He has an engineering degree from a recognized university, he had a stable job and successful life after he graduated. Everything went down with the pandemic and the isolation.

I dont know, and ive thought about this a lot, but i do wonder if there had been no pandemic what wouldve happened. Would Ash not have snapped? Would something else have triggered him? Would someone else open the skeleton closet? The imaginary what ifs are their own adventure, i have pictured so many different lives with happy, sad and tragic endings. I am aware that its not good to fixate on those but sometimes i envy the possibilities.

I will admit though that in my wildest imaginations i did not quite ever picture Ted dying. (He is not dead, let me preface with that, he is doing okay right now). Please remember that while all of this is written from my perspective, the real person in the middle of it was Ted, i was just a casualty.

It took many many therapy sessions to come to terms that it wasnt really my fault, i was just the unfortunate one to have drawn the short stick. What made Ash be the way he ended up was the years of abuse and dismissive attitude from their family and one way or another that wouldve come out regardless of my involvement. Id like to imagine something somehow wouldve convinced him to go to a real therapist and it would have been dealt with in a safe healthy way but i guess well never know. The one thing i have come to be thankful for is that it was me that broke the camels back and not B1s daughter. Things would have been drastically different and much more horrifying.

**Ted (also TW)**

So as you all remember I kinda kept in touch with B6 after the divorce but after the suggestion of many of you and a lot of people in my life i kinda took a step back and distanced myself from him. A few months after I got contacted by B6 asking me if i had heard from Ted recently, which i hadnt and he explained that some family stuff had gone down (he didnt explain what nor did i ask) and that a lot of them had tried to reach out to him but nobody had succeeded. He told me he was worried and that he was making plans to come to our city to check in on him and to let him know if i heard from him.

I know Ted was deliberately keeping his family at a distance, including B6 so it didnt really strike me as odd that they hadnt heard from him, but to give credit when its due its not like Ted to just ignore a family emergency. I shot him a message letting him know that B6 had contacted me looking for him but i didnt hear back from him. At that point Ted and i had distanced ourselves from each other (like it had been suggested over and over in my multiple updates) so it also wasnt alarming when he didnt reply back but he did read my message.

Fast forward about 2 weeks or so and B6 tells me hes in town and would like to meet me. I said yes because i missed him and asked  him to dinner at this new place that i thought hed like and he said no, just coffee. That was weird because B6 is a massive foodie and he never turns down new restaurants but i figured he was in town only for a few days and wanted to spend more time with Ted.

We met at my park and honestly he looked rough, i just remember taking a step back and this feeling of dread. You know when you know a person is going to give you bad news?  To be absolutely honest i thought he was going to tell me that Ash was back in town but he just looked so ready to give up.

He told me that a few more things had come to light in the family (that i wasnt really interested in knowing so i didnt ask for specifics (im sorry i cant provide more hot goss which i know is something that you guys like)) and that when hed come to check on Ted he found him spiraling pretty bad. Ted was never much of a drinker just kinda socially and on special occasions but that when he got to his place he was completely wasted at 10am on a saturday. B6 stayed with him and sobered him up and eventually on sunday he caught him up on the family situation. B6 went out to grab his stuff from his hotel and came back to Ted completely unresponsive. He called emergency services and Ted stayed in the hospital for a bit.

I dont really know if anything else happened to him or if it was just an accumulation of everything that had been happening for the past 2 years catching up with him but it feels to me that he had been going on a self-destructive bender for quite a while. Talking it over with my therapist she kinda implied that that would make sense and it would also kinda explain why the divorce. Maybe im just trying to find a justification of why he divorced me even after all this time but knowing Ted the way that i do that would make sense.

He was always a great protector, i guess he got that trait early in his life protecting Ash. Hes the type of guy to keep an eye out on girls drink at a bar, that always stops to check if an unaccompanied child is okay. He also has some controlling tendencies that most often lead him to anxiety, hes a great planner but has great difficulties when things dont go according to said plan. It makes him rigid at times but also extremely reliable, but those are all things I always loved about him. Many times during our multiple conversations before the divorce he would always apologize for not being able to protect me, for putting me in harm's way and even though I thought I had reassured him that it wasnt his fault I guess he was never convinced.

He was also coming to terms with the reality that his family was not really as nice as he thought, having realized that he himself had taken part in the dismissiveness of the familys actions throughout their childhood, having to realize how bad and horrifying his past was, and how monstrous some of his brothers are. It really takes a toll on a person. He was dealing with his own trauma, the immeasurable guilt he felt and all in all the powerlessness.

Ted ended up in going to a treatment center for a bit. He wouldnt let me visit but he did write me emails. They are a little too personal to share with you guys but it was a very emotional experience reading them. The first few apologetic for making me worry and reassuring me that he was alright. Some others very rambling (and thats coming from me) and some others actually pretty great. It was a very interesting progression seeing him go from hyper polite and apologetic back to the same man i fell in love with. It was also very interesting seeing him internalize things that i had been saying for years, and also gaining insight on things that i hadnt seen before. Overall i think it was cathartic for him (i do think writing is the best outlet hence why im here) and it helped him organize his thoughts. Why emails to me specifically instead of a diary or emails to himself? I have no idea but Im not complaining.

There was one particular email where he was angry at everyone and everything. Everything was wrong and he was frustrated and I felt so relieved. It was amazing reading his spark coming back. When he first emailed me he asked me not to reply to his emails, to just listen (read?) or that if i wanted to i could just delete them and he would be none the wiser.

In the angry email he called me by a nickname that he hadnt used in years, since before we got married, and boy did that piss me off. It wasnt anything serious, he was ranting about a trip we had taken with a few friends and they ended up breaking up in the middle of it and didnt want to go back home because everything was already paid for but refused to be with each other so we ended up splitting boys and girls to do the activities that were planned and he was miserable the entire time. He said something along the lines of I haven't forgiven Alysa for Venice. It was supposed to be you and I Peaches, not me and Rog on a freaking gondola

Its nothing wrong with the pet name itself but it just brought back the feeling of everything i had lost and all of the memories of everything and i went against his request and replied to his email. This led to more correspondence between the two. He didnt take it badly that i replied so i dont know if that was his intention all along or what but we just emailed back and forth for a few weeks and it was nice.

We never talked about Ash or his family when we emailed, i dont know if it was because it just didnt come up naturally or he was avoiding the topic but it was nice just communicating with him like  back in the day. When we first met facebook messenger was the thing we used to communicate and just writing to him brought me back to those days. Its stupid how much i still love him and how much i missed him. Those stupid emails were like getting my best friend back even if he wasnt my husband anymore.

He is now back at his place. B3, his wife and dog lived with him (yay remote work) for a while just until he got properly settled. He now takes antidepressants and has a broader support network and is doing much better. He stopped shutting people out while still maintaining some healthy boundaries which is great. Hes back in touch with B3, B4 and B6 which were always his closets other than Ash. And is absolutely NC with everyone else. I feel a little bad for his niblings because I know he was really close to some of them and I know he misses them but yeah, thats something he definitely needed.

For what is worth B6 also is NC with everyone. He was always kinda distant with everyone other than Ted and Ash im guessing because he *knew* but after everything hes kinda getting closer to B4 and B3 which hey, another silver lining. Im not entirely sure what contact 3 and 4 have with everyone else but i do know that B4 is somewhat involved but he has a clear understanding and respect of the boundaries that Ted set and does not share information with him or of him.

Ted and I have met a few times. Sometimes at friends events others just to catch up and I honestly can tell he is doing good now. Hes regained the weight he lost and his hair is shiny again. You cant see his freckles anymore so hes been spending time in the sun which is good and his shoulders dont sag anymore. He went back to his job this this past week (he was put on LOA) and i can tell how much it gives him a sense of purpose. He was never able to not do anything so I can imagine how that time was extra itchy for him because of that.

We did end up going to a shelter and he adopted an elderly cat. His name is Socks im guessing because he has white paws. Hes a great cat and very loving, hes also missing a bunch of his teeth. Ted has been trying to rename him Macbeth but he doesnt seem to like it. In Teds defense, he also doesnt respond to Socks so maybe hell succeed. I brought Tortilla to visit them and she was very happy to see Ted, she didnt really care for MacSocks but thats because she doesnt like animals bigger than her.

**Back at my parents and life right now**

As I mentioned before, I live on the east coast and 2022 was particularly rough for us. 2 hurricanes hit my town and my apartment flooded. During state of emergency my dad always invites us to their place so at least Tortilla and I were safe but yeah that sucked.

I dont know if it was a message from the universe or divine intervention or what but you know the 2 pairs of shoes that i kept? Ruined. Both of them. I tried everything in my power to save them, even consulted professionals but yeah, ruined beyond repair. I mean, it wasnt only those 2 shoes, like half of my belongings had to be replaced and a bunch of other sentimental things but you guys know about the shoes and my attachment to them even if they were a biohazard.

My poor apartment went through a lot. The floors had to be removed because of the water damage and it was already rotting and molding underneath by the time we were able to go in so that was a big investment to fix, my appliances needed to be replaced (including the robot mop tragically) and most of my furniture too. For the record i did have sandbags but i guess it was too much for them. Insurance covered a portion of of the repairs it but clearly not all (insurance claims suuuuuuuckkkkkkk) and well, it ended up being the best option to fix the things and sell the apartment.

I have always complained about moving but there was something so depressing about moving with just a few boxes. Not even when i went to college did i have so little with me. So im currently staying with my parents. Again. Its a little frustrating but im grateful to be with my parents. The house feels a little lonely because the last of my sisters just moved away to college so its quiet except for the cats running around but hey, cats are great company.

Im in the process of closing on a new apartment. In a high rise this time so this hopefully doesnt happen again. Ill miss my park but the new apartment is in an amazing location with everything nearby. I could also bike to my job if i wanted to but id have to learn how to ride a bike first. Why dont I know how to ride a bike? Because my dad was too overprotective and thought wed die if we got on a bike. I dont know if im too old to learn how to ride a bike now but im willing to bruise my ego and try training wheels.

The new apartment has much bigger windows so therell be lots of sunny patches for Tortilla. I wanted to build a catio at my last place because i did have a small terrace but the new place has a balcony which seems a little unsafe for a catio.

So yeah, thats life right now. Ive been focusing on work and spending time with my parents. I booked myself a trip in march and itll be my first time traveling alone. Im slightly scared because ive never had to plan a trip by myself (did I mention Ted is a great planner?) and i have no idea if im doing things right but thats the point. Ive been taking classes for the language of where im going so well see how much i actually learnt.

I wanna share something as well, which is ultimately why  i ended up writing this update and choosing the title. I did not add it in the tldr because screw the haters, if they dont want to read all of my ramblings why should they be privy to it all?

Back when B6 contacted me about Ted i was afraid that he was telling me that Ash was back and as you now know that was not the case. When Ted was getting help I received a letter at my parents house.

It was a letter from Ash. For the first time in the 2 years since peegate happened i didnt feel dread. I dont know if its because i was receiving Teds emails or maybe ive done some good healing (my therapist really should start charging me more, she refused when i offered her a raise saying that it doesnt work like that) but yeah, i read it.

He apologized. He also owned up to a lot of things he had done to me that i had never noticed were microaggressions on his part and he owned up to a lot of his behaviors that always bothered me.

He didnt try to justify anything just apologize. He admitted to a few other things that were both surprising and not, and some others that a few of you guessed about. It felt a little rambly and desperate but i get it.

He apologized for hurting Ted, that he knew what Ted was going through perhaps more than anyone else and that he understood that he had done irreparable damage and was never going to be in his life again. That even if he couldnt help his brother after everything hed caused he knew that by at least owning up to his mistakes he could at least make it up a little to  me, and that even if Ted never knew about it, it was a small way for him to apologize to him indirectly.

He said a line that I found interesting Im sorry i ruined your marriage, but i dont think i ruined your life. Ted would not have chosen you if you werent resilient. He also thanked me for trying. I tried really hard at first to be friends with him but after the incident of course it was a big nope. He said he had given up on people other than Ted trying for him and that he was sorry he never gave me a chance. He admitted he was jealous that I brought Ted happiness in ways he couldnt and that he regretted that because of him Ted had lost that.

I think it was just a way to try to appease the guilt he was feeling about hurting his favorite person and seeing the actual effect it had on him while also somewhat respecting his boundaries. I mean, he disrespected mine but yeah I get it.

I   havent told Ted about the letter. I dont think I will either. I did tell B6 and even though he was enraged at first he understood and accepted it and told me it was up to me if I told Ted or not. That he didnt think itd do much harm but also wouldnt help anything so that if i felt compelled to tell or show him to wait a while until he was in a better place and that perhaps to run it by his therapist or do it in therapy.

**Closing thoughts**

Christmas has come and gone again and this year i did spend it with my family. My sisters are the best and each of them bought me a pair of shoes to represent my life milestones and they gave me an empty shoebox to represent the pair that ill have to buy to start this new chapter. Its the most sentimental gift ive ever gotten and i cried most of christmas morning because of it.

I saw Ted for New years. We were both invited to a mutual friends party and we had a great time. We didnt intentionally spend the whole time together but we did often end up in our own conversations (without being rude to everyone else) and just laughing together. When midnight struck i was sitting in the back kinda away from the couples and he sat next to me and put his head on my shoulder and we just stayed in comfortable silence while everyone else rang the new year.

Its such a relief to have Ted the friend back. I still love him. I probably always will. Ive tried the distance thing, the no contact, the sleeping with someone else to get him out of my system and it does not work. I dont know if he is my fated soulmate and well always gravitate towards each other or if its just the comfort and convenience of being together for so long but i cant help but love him. I love the man he was before, and i love the man he is right now, and i love the one he was in between and if i'm being honest i'll probably will love the one he will be every day after.

I will not give him up even if i have to give up on him. I rather keep him in my life as my friend than keep pushing him away when im always happiest when hes in my life. I deserve to be happy and he makes me happy. Is that so wrong? I know most  of you keep saying that it was a good riddance and that he did me a favor and we should just cut each other off but i miss him. Maybe it makes me stupid but hey at least I will be stupid and happy. If he asks me to step back i will but im okay with just being happy right now and worrying about the future later. I think both of us deserve that.

We both still have a lot of work to do and a lot more healing coming our ways but for right now things are good, and I think we both need good. I think all of us (you guys included) need good.

If youve made it this far into my ramblings thank you for taking the time i wish you all the good things, may you find a $20 in your pocket, may your favorite drink be in stock at the store. May your coffee be made to perfection.

But seriously thank you guys for always giving me the space to talk about my life without (much) judgment, with love and acceptance and understanding. Each and every one of you is incredible and kind, please always know that i appreciate you and love each of you independently. Thank you for caring for me.

Love,

&gt;I guess the level of enjoyment you get out of Hogwarts Legacy depends on your knowledge of the Harry Potter universe. The more you love this world the more youll enjoy Hogwarts Legacy. Its as simple as that. This doesnt mean that theres nothing here for those who are just getting started with Harry Potter or just want a fantasy world to explore - there certainly is - but Hogwarts Legacy truly feels like a love letter to the fans of J.K Rowlings work, above all.

&gt;Avalanche Software has done it  the comfort, the nostalgia, the freshness, the thrill  everything in Hogwarts Legacy emulsifies together to create a celebration of what the Wizarding World is and what the fans have always dreamed of. This is by far the best Wizarding World video game to ever come out and stands with a select few games that prove more is more.

&gt;If you're already a Harry Potter fan, there will certainly be something for you at Hogwarts Legacy, even with a completely different range of characters from the one you're used to. The music, the different classrooms, the ghosts wandering around, the paintings on the walls, the poltergeist Peeves, it's all so nostalgic that, for a moment, I returned to my adolescence. If you're not entirely familiar with the Harry Potter lore, it'll be a little harder to understand some of the game's mechanics, but don't worry: you still have a huge world to explore, dozens of puzzles, collectibles and creatures to capture. Who knows, your journey into the world of sorcery begins here!

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a fully fleshed action RPG with everything that belongs to that. The fights are fun, the magic based riddles are nice, the presentation is beautiful, even if the game does not deliver a technically through and through next-gen experience. Don't think so much about the open world, think more about a magical atmosphere, that should reach any RPG player, in particular fans of the Harry Potter franchise.

&gt;Whether youre a diehard Potterhead or casual Wizarding World lover, youll have an epic time no matter what level of fan you are.
&gt;
&gt;Even though there is optional padding, its optional nonetheless. The core experience of Hogwarts Legacy is still not only the best game in the entire franchise but a seriously fun RPG that will take your breath away in its pinnacle moments.

&gt;All in all, 80 points to Hufflepuff.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacys wonderful world makes it one of those games that you'd just love to keep experiencing for the first time - forever - and we envy anyone who's yet to step into it. Even if its just a regular, open-world game underneath all the magic, it truly is an excellent one.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a solid first attempt. If Avalanche can be accused of anything, it's that the studio has tried to do too much all at once. Something was always going to give  between the massive open world, the messy RPG economy, exciting action combat, and adventure story that wants to cast you as a hero with homework due on Monday.

&gt;Even if you are a relative stranger to its source material, the way Hogwarts Legacy introduces magic and all of its astonishing quirks, helped by a cast whose performances are always worth a watch, and bookended by a satisfying combat and exploration loop, this is an unforgettable experience from start to finish. By melding the allure of the Harry Potter franchise with an interconnected gameplay system that is always pushing players forward to the next entertaining activity, the game is more than able to keep you under its spell for a long, long time.

&gt;Pushing the J.K. Rowling controversy to the side, Hogwarts Legacy is a true celebration of the magical universe that she created which perfectly transitioned to film. Her universe has equally been adapted well into this game courtesy of Avalanche Studios with its gameplay and story. Whether the story will become canon is yet to be seen but again this is as close as you can get to the core of what the extended universe of Harry Potter can be that not only plays well on the PS5 but looks fantastic.

There's an intriguing mystery to unravel, though you're bound to spend most of your time exploring a wealth of side content, visiting virtual landmarks and roleplaying as a Hogwarts student. That said, it's more successful in being a sandbox teeming with nostalgia rather than a stand-out action RPG in its own right, let down by gameplay foibles and spellcasting combat that quickly slides into repetition.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy brilliantly captures the magic of the world of Harry Potter with its beautiful open world, engaging characters and exciting combat.

&gt;In terms of story, Hogwarts Legacy also manages to capture the magical feel of Harry Potter. It does it successfully by being set a good century before the events of the novels. We'll meet a few Weasleys, even a gaunt, to name a few. The only known characters from the other formats you'll know are the ghosts of Hogwarts, with you crossing with Peeves, chatting with Nearly-Headless Nick (if you're Gryffindor, I assume other houses will be different) and other longer-term fixtures. Fortunately, and as far as I am, the game manages to forge its path incredibly well, adding in a few canonical elements, such as ancient magic. I'm not at the end, so if it is canon, I'm curious how they explain away the lack of ancient magic in later stories.

2023-02-05,1675558461,"(FHM) A Gauntlet once thrown: (Round 6) The Showman v.s. The Showstopper","Well folks, we have seen some impressive& and terrifying fights, Harry began before shuddering.

Who wouldve thought that children could be so dangerous? Anyways are we ready for round six?!!! The audience all cheered and whooped in response to his question.

Awh shucks Linky& It seems that the audience is all tuckered out watching the fights guess we should end the tournament here and now& because I asked ARE YOU READY FOR ROUND SIX?!!! The arena began to shake at the sheer volume of the audience shouting and cheering in response.

Much better; first, our next contestant requires no introduction, but I will give her one anyway. She is the lady's man, who is also a lady. She is the one who can capture all our hearts while leaving them beating in our chests& ladies and gentlemen& GENTLEMAN JACK!!!

As Harry gestured to the right-hand tunnel, an explosion of colourful smoke burst on either side of the tunnel exit, while above the arena, fireworks began to burst, lighting up the dimming sky with a rain of colourful sparks.

As the sparks fell to the ground, they all began to warp and take the shapes of woodland animals. Everything from deer to little rabbits. All the animals began to hop and scamp around the arena before stopping on either side of the tunnel exit.

Uh, ah, ah, ahhhh& a melodic voice rang out of the tunnel. The little illusionary animals all tweeted, whistled or responded to the tune.

Uh, ah, ah, ah, ahhhhh, once again, a melodic voice echoed out somehow even more angelic than the first time. As with before, the animals all chorused in response as if beckoning the owner of the voice to step out into the light.

Out of the tunnel exit in a beautiful ballgown that flowed like it was made of clouds and dreams glided Jacksmoothly moving between the crowd of now bowing illusionary animals.

I thank you, little creatures, for your lovely voices awoke me from my millennia-long slumber, Jack said lovingly to the illusionary creatures that looked visibly bashful as they began to dissipate. The audience watching this show before them were left speechless as they watched Jack glide towards her starting position.

As soon as Jack reached the halfway point between the tunnel exit and her mark, she hopped on the spot and did a kick-flip on a skateboard concealed beneath her skirt before skidding to a halt in front of Harry and Lincoln.

What-up old farts? Jack said, giving a friendly wave to the duo. Harry, however, gave a big double barrel thumbs up to Jack, fully approving of such a showy entrance.

Our next contestant is such that I feel I must introduce her in a unique way, So I will begin!! Brilliance before baffle-fields& bringing beautiful bright butterflies behind boastful beasts because best brings bountiful blocks of bold bullion bet on boundless bounties& BAH!!! Bastards bemoan& beg& bow& before BEA!!!

With his oratorial assault on the second letter of the alphabet, Bea began walking out of the left-hand tunnel flanked by six cloaked figures in dark robes.

Unlike Jack, she didnt enter with fanfare and fireworks. She just walked with purpose, accompanied by her companions, whoever they werestopping at her mark Lincoln looked expectantly at her companions.

Uh& Bea, this is only a fight between you and Jack& Your friends will need to- Harry began before all six figures flung off their robes, revealing they were each a pair of Beas standing on each other's shoulders.

I know the rules, dont worry, I am the only one here, one of the Beas standing on a set of shoulders replied.

Indeed we may Bea many& but we are still only Bea! another declared as they circled around the core Bea.

Looking at all thirteen, Beas, Jack, Harry, and Lincoln could see each had a pair of pupils, and all seemed to have a second voice overlaying her normal voice.

I must protest, ref, Jack said, stepping forward, unwilling to surrender the spotlight to Bea.

This is unfair; she has clearly been casting preparatory spells before entering. Just look at her magical clones!!

Indeed I did; we are currently buffed such that we could defeat our dear Gunter in a straight-up fight& But please, good Gentleman Jack, tell me this& where in the rules does it say we cannot do this?

Buh-it-Guh! Jack began to sputter as she looked at Lincoln. Lincoln, however, just nodded his head and gestured to Bea.

Hear that, folks?!!! Harry shouted down his device; unfortunately, while Harry was a quick study in stoic, the audience wasnt. So they didnt hear what was being implied.

Bea here is correct; despite no rule explicitly stating it was forbidden, every combatant so far has not pre-buffed themselves nor cast spells to their advantage with one exception.

But I am sure there is a rule about casting spells before the fights begin!!

Indeed, there is one... The combatants arent allowed to cast attack spells before the round officially begins& these are not attack spells. Harry and Jack looked to Lincoln, who once again nodded, confirming Bea was correct. Lincoln then leant down and whispered something to Harry.

Folks, I have just been informed Kline the Worderer had six high-level defensive spells imprinted on his back prior to entering, Harrys declaration sent a stir through the arenas audience.

Any more objections? Bea asked.

None, Jack replied through gritted teeth.

Perfect, Gentleman Jack. Do you have any words to say to your opponent before we begin?

I do, Jack said as she took the device from harry. I hope your stature is the only thing small about you because& I dont look down that often, and you are a tad too short to be worth my time, Jack taunted before handing the device back to Harry.

Ok, Bea, do you have anything to say? Bea nodded and took the device from Harry, and held it between her and her twelve other copies. All twelve took in a deep breath as they harmonised one phrase.

Jack is a biiiiiitcccchhhh!!

With her harmonics completed, she handed the device back to Harry, who was getting increasingly disconcerted by these kids he was acting as an announcer for.

With the provocations given and any potential rule breaks dealt with, the duo retreated to their usual booth and rang the gong to signal the start of the round. Jack, the moment this happened, clicked her heels together and began waltzing up into the sky.

I am the real New Year's Fairy Waltz& see me glide through the air effortlessly, Jack declared as she continued to dance higher and higher out of Beas reach.

As she did this, Jack looked up to the glowing dim, signalling the start of the evenings approach. She couldnt help but admire the view from way up high. Her view, however, was interrupted as a net made of light energy began to form above her.

Looking down to the arena, she could see that all thirteen Beas had formed a ritual circle and were casting the spell mananet. A spell that required a minimum of a duo of casters working together to cast it. But with thirteen Beas all working together, it was cast in one-sixth the time it usually would take.

Now thoroughly trapped in a net, Jack watched in horror as all thirteen Beas yanked on the ropes connected to the net, dragging her to the floor. Groaning as she stood up, she looked down and checked herself. That's when she saw it&

MY DRESS!!!! YOU GOT MY DRESS DIRTY!!!! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO MADE THIS?!!! Jack roared in unrestrained fury as she put her arms out wide, transforming her bracelets into a silvery shield and falchion.

I would say Im going to cut you to size, but I guess bite size would be more accurate, Jack said as she began approaching the Beas.

The Beas, however, werent content to stand still and began running around Jack from every direction. Every so often, slapping a hand coated in an elemental attack. Slowly but surely, more of Jacks fancy dress began to get torn and burnt up. With parts covered in a green ichor.

To make matters worse, Bea had mastered a skill that Mimi had taught herconcealed mana thread. Previously when Bea controlled her other selves, there would be visible mana threads. She knew how to create a depot body to keep control from a different body. But now, the threads were invisible to the naked eye. Only people with mana sight would know which Bea was the real one now.

STAY STILL AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN!!!

We are both girls, though?

SHUT UP AND FIGHT FAIR THEN!!!!

My teacher taught me that there is no such thing as fair in a real fight, and only an idiot will follow the rules when fighting, Bea replied as it appeared more and more of her were manoeuvring around Jack.

ENOUGH!!! Jack roared as she took out three reagent packets and began to mutter a spell under her breath. When she completed the spell, she slammed a fist into the ground causing the area floor to warp and change shape.

Much like Daisy had done against Maelsteez, Jack had altered the terrain and stopped the Beas ability to manouver freely. While from the audiences perspective, Jack now stood in the centre of a large stone flower. Even when retaliating, Jack had to do it in a showy manner.

Finally got you, Jack muttered, seeing some of the Beas rubbing fresh bruises where they had been hit by the spell.

Ha-ha-ha-ha, much to Jack's chagrin, all thirteen Beas began to laugh as one.

Whats so funny?!! Jack demanded, not being fond of being made the centre of a joke she herself hadnt made.

You are incredibly dumb& you know that, right?

You little& Ill have you know I am one of the highest-graded students in this academys history. I HAVE BROKEN RECORDS!!! That is why I am permitted to behave the way I do!!

Oh, I know all that; part of my preparation was to study up on all my opponents. The only rest I got from Mimi hitting all thirteen of me from a dozen angles simultaneously. But it is knowing about that that will let me beat you. I even had my sparring partners use each of your team's preferred methods of fighting to get experience.

What has any of this got to do with me being dumb? Get to the point already!!

Simple, you have a big weakness, Bea replied as all her copies began walking in a circle around Jack.

I dont have any weaknesses.

Youre fooling yourself if you think that's true. But your weakness is a good one& it is a strength under the right circumstances.

What is it then, pray tell?

You are highly adaptable, and due to your intelligence, you can actually adopt other spells by only seeing them once, Bea replied.

And you say that is a weakness?

Yep, it is also a strength& but here, against me, it is a weakness. You see, you used the method Daisy used to beat Maelsteez, warp the terrain to stop an agile foe.

Exactly, I stopped you, and you call this a weakness?

Well, the thing is, I was watching the fights as intently as you were& I was also watching you and keeping close watch of the parts that especially caught your attention.

Does this spiel have a point?

Simple; what if I set my plan into motion with the intent of you warping the arena floor?

Hah& That would be& Jacks voice trailed off as she pondered Beas meaning.

And of course, as you said at the start& you dont look down unless you have to, Bea added.

Jack realising her meaning, looked down and could now see it. A magical circle that had been carved into the arena floor. One that her own warping of the floor had fully connected. What had once been nothing but a fragmented circle was whole thanks to her using a technique she had seen in an earlier round.

You see, Lady Jack& we werent even playing the same game& Something you learn when facing a real speedster is to aim where they are going to be, not where they are. All the better if you can force them to be where you aim, As Bea said this, all thirteen Beas stopped walking and stomped on the floor.

All at once, lines they had been carving since the beginning began to light up with Jack at the spell's focal point. Before she could react, Jack had magically conjured chains begin to wrap around her arms, legs and torso. All of which were dragging her down to the floor.

Jack, it doesnt matter how fast, strong or even insane you are. If your opponent can predict your movements, you are nothing but a game piece, the Beas explained in unison as they approached the now fully restrained Jack.

Concede, Bea demanded as she slapped the ground and drew out a stone dagger.

I wont! Jack shouted back, refusing.

Concede, or your pretty face will become less pretty, Bea warned as she held the knife to Jacks cheek.

I wont!!! Jack continued to refuse till the moment she felt a prick pierce the skin on her cheek.

FINE, I CONCEDE!!!... You win&

With her words, Harry and Lincoln stepped out into the arena from their booth and approached the group of Beas.

Ladies and Gentlemen& By forfeit, we have a winner& BEA BLACKGATE!!!! The crowd screamed and cheered for Beas victory.

# Kyiv-Mohyla Academy

[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy today.](https://preview.redd.it/7483dbyq2vka1.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66f392735f424a2130e41f0e1fc4bef045b79e95)

**The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy** was founded in 1615 on the basis of the Kyiv Church School. This was possible thanks to the generous gift of money and land by a noblewoman from Volyn, Halshka Hulevychivna.  The academy was founded on principles of humanism and enlightenment.

The academy was supported by various influential circles of Ukrainians - political figures, spiritual leaders and even the military vanguard.  Teachers from all over Ukraine, especially from the learning centers of Lviv and Lutsk moved to Kyiv specifically to teach at the school, which immediately enjoyed the strong support of the Zaporozhian Kozak Army.

Metropolitan Petro Mohyla of Kyiv, a prominent Ukrainian spiritual and public leader, built out Kyiv Academy, taking it to a new level and making it one of the most impressive universities of Europe at the time.  Some time after his death, given his key role in developing this University, it received the name Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in his honor.  Colloquially it is often called Mohylyanka, a diminutive nickname.

# Illustrious Alumni

Many famous graduates over the centuries hailed from Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.  In particular, almost all the future military leaders of Ukraine studied at Mohylyanka.  This includes legendary heroes of Ukrainian statehood [Ivan Mazepa](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/twlhe4/626_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_41st_day_of_the/) and his colleague, the author of the first Ukrainian Constitution that is considered the [oldest democratic constitution of the modern era, Pylyp Orlyk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/txcr29/624_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_42nd_day_of_the/).

The famous poet-philosopher [Hryhoriy Skovoroda](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uks2f3/521_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_74th_day_of_the/), whose monument stands near the academy, also studied here.

The Kyiv-Mohyla Academy is thought to have had pretty progressive policies for the day.  According to the statutes of the Academy, everyone who wanted to study had the right to study there.  The children of Ukrainian aristocracy, Cossack officers, regular Cossacks, clergy and farmers studied there together.  A full course of study at the school was considered to be 12 years, but students had the ability to study there as long as they wanted, without age restrictions or consideration of social background. Students of lower grades were never expelled for missing school or for not having completed their homework& As a rule students were given the benefit of the doubt, and the institution focused on building independent skills and critical thinking.

[1992 postage stamp featuring art from 1701.  In this case, the date is listed as 1632 because that is the year the church school was merged into the academy though it was originally founded in 1615.](https://preview.redd.it/7atrwm2iouka1.png?width=1597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bcf8edfeb7be0ed83952c83b3bfbdc2a921ec2e2)

In the beginning, all higher sciences, starting with poetics, were taught in Latin.  Over time, however, the Ukrainian literary language claimed more and more space in the academy. The Ukrainian language was used to write poems, scientific, artistic and political treatises, chronicles, letters, court acts, and to compose sermons and teachings. In 1738, German was introduced into the educational curriculum, and from 1753 - French, as Kyiv-Mohyla Academy began to broaden its horizons and gain a stellar international reputation for the school.  Approximately at the same time, the russian language was added.

# Trouble

However, in 1784, in accordance with the linguicide brought on by the policies of russification introduced by empress Catherine II of russia, professors at Kyiv-Mohyla Academy were forbidden to give lectures in Ukrainian.  Later in 1804 there was a further decree that banned all Ukrainian-language schools in general, which led to the complete educational degradation of the Ukrainian population.  In 1847, a general ban on works of Ukrainian writers and poets like Taras Shevchenko was introduced.  And famously, in 1863, the Valuev Circular issued by the minister of internal affairs of the russian empire stated that the Ukrainian language ""never existed, doesn't exist, and cannot exist.""  Sounds kind of familiar doesnt it?  History rhymes.

We covered the hundreds of acts of linguicide established by russia in occupied Ukraine in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/usspzl/505_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_85th_day_of_the/). 

After the October Revolution of 1917, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy was shuttered.  In 1935, the Bolsheviks destroyed the Epiphany Cathedral of the Brethren Monastery that belonged to the academy.  Soviets repurposed many buildings of the Academy, and some buildings were repurposed into the Kyiv Naval Political College - an absurd place that churned out the political commissars of the soviet navy.

As the soviet nightmare ended in 1991, Ukrainians immediately started working on reviving its most prized university.  Much like [Ostroh Academy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/10mbj00/740_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_338th_day_of_the/) from the first entry of this series, it would not have happened without the passion of a visionary.  Literary scholar and educator **Vyacheslav Briukhovetskyi** was the beacon of this initiative and it is said he even put President Kravchuk on the spot by asking him in a very public setting if he is in favor of reopening the Academy.

# The Deans Gambit

[Professors gather with students on the first day of matriculation, August 24th, 1992.](https://preview.redd.it/tcdnfr3nnuka1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7b0586e9961c9186c2c1d3aadfe0259c96f1bb6b)

Kyiv-Mohyla Academy opened its doors again on 24 August 1992  the first anniversary of Ukraine regaining independence.  But it didnt happen without a funny story!  Urban legend has it that even though there was huge public support to reopen the Academy, many of its premises legally still belonged to the Naval School.  The administration of the military school did not want to give in.  Vyacheslav Briukhovetskyi would not take no for an answer. 

He had already gotten the president of the country to agree to reopen the university, so clearly for him the president of the military school and navy admiral was not intimidating at all!  And so Dr. Briukhovetskyi set about visiting the admiral almost daily, trying to convince him to at least *share* the premises.  The two men became somewhat friendly, and the admiral eventually asked his new friend to go out for lunch with him.  We are not entirely sure how it happened, but rumor has it that Briukhovetskyi made a bet with the admiral on a game of chess: if Briukhovetskyi would win, the Naval college would grant an auditorium to Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.  The admiral agreed, as he was a chess master& but to his surprise, he lost.  The Academy gained its first space.

[A jubilant crowd walks to the university on opening day, August 24th, 1992.](https://preview.redd.it/dy2vfnj8nuka1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=daee812c021c0094ebc3ee2b5021119721490379)

The challenges of those initial years of reopening the school were substantial due to the economic hardship of the 1990's.  But again - it was pure *passion* that kept the school alive.  Today, it is known as National University of Kyiv-Mohyla and enjoys a stellar reputation as a prominent institution and thrives in a free and democratic Ukraine.

# Architecture

[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy on the 500 hryvnia note.](https://preview.redd.it/dquofd2zkuka1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3e6d5f0d4453210ef238d9011aa678c2e98591ac)

Today, the **National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy** occupies nine buildings.  Some of them are true gems from former times of Kozak glory.  As we mentioned, the Zaporozhian Army took a patronage over the school and sponsored its expansion.  Probably the most beloved structure is the Mazepa Building, the main university building since the 17th century thanks to the personal and devoted sponsorship of Hetman Ivan Mazepa.  Today, it is depicted on the 500 hryvnia banknote (and on the other side is alumnus [Skovoroda](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uks2f3/521_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_74th_day_of_the/)).

But the oldest building of the school is called The House of Halshka Hulevychivna, that lady with serious money we mentioned earlier who gave the Academy its initial financial boost.  It's actually the oldest well-preserved public building in Kyiv.

Another little gem of the academy is a funky sun dial created in the 18th century for its students by French professor Pierre Brullion.

[Sun dial by the academy's French professor Pierre Brullion.](https://preview.redd.it/gx6bpmyqjuka1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=81183a0e90d0ab76bb4ff98e7f4055ead303e9b6)

The newer academic buildings were built in 1822-25, and during soviet occupation many soviet symbols and inscriptions (""Learn, learn, learn... V. I. Lenin"";  and ""Party - mind, honor and conscience of our era. V. I. Lenin"") were added.  These inscriptions were kept as a reminder of the totalitarian nightmare.

Kyiv-Mohyla Academy's professors and students have been impressive for centuries, and this bravery - both intellectual and physical - continues.  

In 2004, Mohylyanka students and professors were very active in protests against the falsification of the presidential election.  Later, thousands of students of the academy were at Maidan in 2013-2014 in force.  Students and graduates of Mohylyanka, like thousands of other Ukrainians, went to the front to defend Ukraine from the enemy.  Many students have given their lives to defend Ukraine.

The Office of Civil Rights [sent me a letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/627583772/06222136-TWU-NDL-C?secret_password=36tppox1vx3L5xKeMMNd) announcing they opened an investigation based on my complaint.

What prompted my complaint to OCR that kicked all this off was that Texas State Bill 1126 declares Texas Woman's University (TWU) as a ""woman-focused"" university system. This means it is a violation of Title IX for the federal government to be providing federal student loans, research grants etc to TWU.

# Highlights

Where there is smoke, there is fire. I began looking into TWU for a comprehensive rundown of their public-facing violations. What I found:

1. The state is using them to provision grants and workshops to women who run businesses.
2. They run workshops for women to increase their political power. Increasing the political power of women is not bad. A public coed school discriminating is however.
3. They do not have sports roster slots for men proportional to the student body. Schools with a similar number (total count) of men are able to field 4-5 men's teams. As far as I can tell, there is only one male-presenting person on their rosters this year.
4. A litany of sex-based scholarships, grants, and opportunities at TWU. Heck, [they even advertise the violations explicitly](https://i.imgur.com/i5nylDK.png).
5. The student regent position has never been awarded to a man. This student serves on the board of regents for the university system and after a multi-phase selection process, is selected from one of two people by the governor of the state. OCR declined to investigate this.

The scale of the violations has led OCR to investigating entire *institutes* at the school. This is unheard of in my activism. Not once have I managed to get OCR to look holistically at a group running the violations. They have always focused on individual programs and ignore that a group that is committing so many violations is itself the problem. This is a tough thing to make happen, and with an OCR that tends to be hostile to men's complaints, getting this to happen means there are some serious problems at TWU.

# Timeline

A little timeline of TWU, partially sourced from their website.

1901  The Girls Industrial College was founded by an act of the 27th Texas Legislature.

1930  Graduate studies are established at the college.

1934  The colleges name changes to Texas State College for Women.

1957  The colleges name changes to Texas Womans University.

1972  Men are admitted into TWUs graduate programs and  undergraduate and graduate health sciences professions programs in  Denton, Dallas and Houston. **THIS IS THE YEAR TITLE IX PASSED**

1994  Men are admitted to all undergraduate degree programs at TWU.

2018  The Institute for Women's Leadership is established to  serve the State of Texas as a resource for scholarship and research and  to prepare more women to take on successful roles in business and public  service.

2023  OCR opens a federal investigation into anti-male discrimination.

# Regarding Sports

TWU has had sports since before Title IX passed according to NCAA records. Yet, decades later, they are still out of compliance. To add fuel to the fire, TWU's athletics dept was heralding Title IX turning 50 last year. They were claiming that it is the reason their women can compete in what was traditionally a ""boys sport."" But that isn't the case, as TWU can provision whatever sports they want. TWU controls the rosters. They had sports before Title IX. So while they were running this huge campaign highlighting Title IX, they were knowingly in a violation since it's inception.

When I called them out on this while also announcing the investigation by OCR, they blocked me. This is a violation of my first amendment rights, as they are a government funded institution and I was commenting on policy and official actions. There are many court cases to support this claim. It was also retaliation for engaging in a federally protected activity. This has all been added to the investigation by OCR.

# Implications of Fraud

While OCR would never pursue it, there are some serious concerns regarding fraud here. Schools are required to attest to compliance with civil rights laws and funding regulations to get federal financial assistance such as student loans and grants. Given the decades of flagrant violations spanning the entire university system, TWU should have known they were not compliant. Yet they are getting federal money anyway. Anyone who attested to compliance has likely committed fraud. Absent media attention, no one will ever look into this. So get out there, and help me get the media to pick up on the story.

# What's Next

**Me:**

Title IX required that schools who were single sex prior to 1972 (when it passed) that are forced to move to coed must submit a transition plan to the dept of education. I have requested a copy of this transition plan via FOIA to see what it looks like and shine some light on what TWU did or did not do. They clearly failed at transitioning to being a coed school. TWU is has the worst gender gap for undergraduate schools larger than 4000 students (13% men), and the graduate schools larger than 500 students (10% men) using 2020 NCES IPEDS data.

I have requested a copy via FOIA of all the applications for student regent since inception, which applications survived each round of selection, and any notes the selectors included in their recommendation to the next round of selectors. I expect this will cost me a couple thousand which is fine. I plan on using it to appeal the dismissal of this specific allegation, or file a new complaint if the timeline to appeal has elapsed.

**You:**

Contact media regarding this, no one has picked it up yet, and it is a huge story. TWU runs the risk have having their federal funding pulled over it.

If you are in the US, contact your elected federal representatives and let them know about the case. Ask what their thoughts and plans are for addressing anti-male discrimination and under enrollment in higher education.

If you are in Texas, contact your state representatives and ask about changing SB1129 so that it doesn't discriminate against men in violation of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause.","MensRights",30,"https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11962wa/dept_of_education_office_of_civil_rights_opens/"

It had been the better part of five days since the dining incident, and Maxwell had refused to come out of his room. He was confused and conflicted by his own actions. A swirling storm of emotions threatened to overtake him.

As he was content to stew on his own emotions, he refused to let anyone else into his room, locking the door to prevent anyone from entering. The rest of the class and a few of his friends from other classes had still made attempts at contact, but he had refused them.

As he sat at the foot of his bed curled up in a ball, he kept going over the event in his head. It had seemed so right in the moment. A primal call to protect Johan. Like a mother who lifts a cart off their child with sheer strength. It was all instinct, and it scared him.

Maxwell typically was the sort that would not flinch at blood but would never seek it out, either. But he had lost all control of something deep inside him, and he didnt know how to react. As these thoughts began to snowball once more, a knock at his door broke his focus.

Leave the food at the door; Im still too ill to greet you, Maxwell said, putting on what he thought was a convincing croak.

This was all the performance he had put on. With what had happened that night, he couldnt just admit he had nearly accidentally killed a visiting diplomat. It had been settled to cover up the incident and have Maxwell serve the rest of his time in school under house arrest. Only being permitted to leave school grounds under the supervision of an assigned guardian. The knock wrapped against the door once again.

I said leave the meal at the door, please, Maxwell grumbled, forgetting to put on the hoarse tone he had been using. Another knock at the door.

Please go away!

Are you ok, Maxwell? Alexs voice asked through the door.

Sir?

Yes, its me; I heard you were& that you were feeling unwell. I came to check up on you as is my duty as your teacher and present guardian.

I am just feeling unwell and would like to recuperate alone& dont want it to spread.

Oh, Maxy, I dont think it will spread, Alex replied as Maxwell heard something sliding against the door as if someone slid down to sit against it.

You know the guys are all worried about you?

I know& theyve come here a few times, Maxwell admitted.

And you want to keep them worried about you?

It wont matter for much longer, Maxwell replied as he realised what he had just suggested.

Are you planning a self-treatment then? Alex asked, concern clear in his voice. Because doing that for a silly little illness is very foolish.

It was an illness I couldve prevented!!

Maxy& I know illnesses. I have experienced my fair share of them. I know from experience that remaining isolated doesnt help as much as the illness makes you think it will.

Maxwell had to hold back his hand that he only now realised was reaching out for the door. He would endure his suffering alone; he couldnt let anyone in. Sitting here and now alone, he couldnt help but recall what his brother used to say when they were younger.

You will never be a real Greyback. You have too much failure in you!!! Celes had always been a right bastard blind to his own faults, but here and now, knowing what he had done, Maxwell couldnt help but begin to agree.

Maxy? Alex asked, worried about the quiet.

Im still here, Maxwell reassured him.

Can I come in?

No, Maxwell replied.

You know I can come in anyway, right? Alex asked.

Pfft, yeah, Id like to see that, Maxwell laughed despite himself, only to realise he had invited his teacher to show off a power. Something Alex was never unwilling to do.

Looking to the door, Maxwell held his breath as a shimmering black smoke began to rise up off of the woodwork. This smoke began to merge and become thicker and thicker till it had a vaguely humanoid form. Only a few seconds had passed, but to Maxwell, it felt like an eternity. With very little time at all, the smoke solidified into Alex, who promptly collapsed to the floor, coughing.

Gods shouldve practised that before trying it for the first time, he grumbled between coughs.

That was your first time using that spell? Maxwell asked, momentarily losing himself in his teacher's ridiculousness.

Yes, been preparing to use it for ages, but I never thought the debut would be to get into a troubled student's room.

Pfft& Maxwell couldnt help but snicker at how ridiculous Alex truly was.

So what is the spell? Maxwell asked.

Smoke form.

Isnt that a vampire racial spell& sir, did you become a vampire?!!

What?! No& All vampires have smoke form, but not all people with smoke form are vampires, Alex explained as he sat down on the floor next to Maxwell.

Damn lungs were the last things to shift back, so they were full of smoke, Alex explained with a cheeky grin.

So you ok? Alex asked, looking at Maxwell with evident concern.

Im ok, sir- Alex made a zzzzttt noise as Maxwell tried to reassure him.

No lying allowed, now are you ok?

I already said I am ok- again, Alex made a buzzing noise.

I already said no lying is allowed.

What do you want then, sir?!!! For me to say, I feel horrible?!!! For me to say that I will probably have to be put to death if this gets out?!!! Do you want me to drag my friends and family down because I lost myself?!!! WHAT DO YOU WANT?!!!!

That, Alex replied, gesturing to Maxwell.

Keeping it bottled up is never good, Maxy. I know suffering& I know what it looks like& I know that look in your eyes all too well, Maxy, and it breaks my heart to see you like this, Alex began as the two locked eyes with one another.

I just& Maxwell began before pausing as his lower lip began to tremble. I just dont know what to feel, sir.

That is the evil little trick that illness can pull. It confuses the feelings, it makes what you know and what you feel two entirely different things, and that dissonance is torture. Maxy, I am just going to sit here because being alone with this illness is far worse than having company.

Maxwell wanted to protest Alex staying. He wanted to yell at him to get out. He wanted to rage and cry and overcome this maelstrom of emotions swirling inside him. But he couldnt; now he actually had someone here; the last thing he wanted was for them to go.

We can just sit here, Maxwell finally agreed as he leaned against the foot of his bed and sat in silence.

Several hours had passed by the time Alex stepped out of Maxwells room. The boy had spent the entire time in silence, but Alex knew having someone there was all that mattered. Turning around to glance one last time at Maxwell, who had fallen asleep, Alex set off towards the walking church. Arriving at the feet of the giant beast, Alex approached the guards, who went to block his way.

Halt!!! They both chorused.

I am Lord Alexander Guntherian; I am here to visit Cardinal Johan Pleidies, Alex announced.

The two guards shared glances before one of them went up the steps of the folded-down tower to ask for orders. After a few minutes, the guard returned and declared Johan had been expecting Alex to visit him.

Climbing the steps, Alex stepped into the walking church's main building and was left in awe of the structure's interior. He had seen Sithys hoard, small as it was due to his youth; it was still a sight to behold. But this church on the back of an earthen drake was more than he could imagine.

What he had first taken to be stained glass windows he now could see were masses of interconnected precious gems. Columns of silver and gold snaked along the walls, and the altar was plated in divinium. He knew that if anyone was able to steal this church, just the materials alone would buy him a kingdom.

Ah, Alexander, it warms this old heart to see you again, Johan said as he hobbled out of a back room.

Likewise, Alex replied, bowing his head.

I wondered when you would come here.

Well, we still need to settle this situation, Alex replied.

Oh, and here I am thinking it was because I sent many invitations, Johan replied.

I apologise for that; I have been busy, sadly. But I am here now, Alex said, giving as best a smile as he could manage.

Now I am more than happy to forget this whole incident occurred. The boy wasnt in his right mind, and I would hate for a war to occur just because my power caused a conflict in a young lad's mind, Johan explained.

I agree. I think we should sweep this whole ordeal under the rug, Alex said, nodding.

With that agreed, lad, I suggest you sit down. Following Johans suggestion, Alex sat down in one of the pews marvelling at how comfortable it was.

I know you have a sister.

Mimi, yes, Alex replied.

No, a younger sister& Johan replied before trailing off.

Shes dead, Alex stated flatly.

Alexander& she yet lives. I took her into my care after that nasty business with your home village-

NASTY BUSINESS?!!! You crucified my entire family& you people then set fire to the village to let them suffer!!! And you call that NASTY BUSINESS?!!!!

Yes, Im sorry poor choice of words&  Alexander, I am truly sorry for what happened& I know my words will never make up for what we have done&. But I have cared for little Lucy as if she were my own flesh and blood. I have a letter here for you from her; she asked me to deliver it when we met, Johan reached into the folds of his robe and produced a sealed letter.

Alex took the proffered letter, broke the wax seal, and began reading its contents.

&amp;#x200B;

--------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

*Hello Dearest Brother,*

*I apologise for, the manner this letter has arrived. Not writing you, was my way of granting your already troubled soul peace. I am writing to you to ensure they stopped all, your schemes. I have thought long and hard about the possible letters I sent you; so many possibilities but this letter is what I chose. I ask you, to see the light of the gods and seek redemption through the Theocracy.*

*Do not believe, the lies of the Dark Lord and her cohorts. Please believe in the Cardinal carrying this letter Johan he knows, gods& gods Alex!!! You cant keep going as you have moving He has a, way to grant you salvation. I hope with his help and when we meet you will know blessing as he, has guided many others to the gods embrace. My truest hope has convinced people he, can save you as he saved me.*

*Brother please see that much of the world speaks of you Is a fool, you of all people; should be aware that perceptions can affect your way of life. You should know beware, of the lies of those you call friends as they will betray you. Im sure to you your friends are like a priest is to me. Sloth is probably more like a priest than anyone else but beware the foolish priest; brother for he leads you to slaughter.*

Alex read the letter; then he re-read it over and over before looking up at Johan.

I thank you for delivering this, Alex said as he embraced Johan in a big hug that lasted a few minutes.

I&I must go now& I hope your journey home leaves you in good health.

And you, Johan replied as he watched Alex leave the walking church. Alex took the long way home from where the earthen drakes were resting. He reread the letter another time, reading the hidden message within.

When they were little, Alex had been taught to read and write with the intention of taking over his father's medical practice.

Lucy, ever the genius sat in the corner of the room during these lessons and had become literate herself. Alex and Lucy had even devised a way to pass messages with hidden codes. She was using the rule that the three words before every comma and four words before every semicolon would create the message.

They banked on the fact that since they were peasants and children at that, lousy grammar would be less of a noticeable issue. Alex now knew he had to pass on a message to Crozonia to prepare for war because it was now closer than ever before, and Johans days were now numbered.

**Hello Dearest Brother. I apologise for not writing you they stopped all letters I sent you. I ask you do not believe Johan. He knows he has a blessing he has convinced people he is a fool. You, of all people, should know. Beware the foolish priest.**

**June 11th, year 024 Angels Descent**

Lucy was enjoying reading a litany of reports from the various sources compiled by the Cardinal of Purities Inquisitors. So much information and so much of it her mind could extrapolate. Her mind was like a devouring void never sated with the information she fed it.

MY LADY!!!! A servant cried out as she rushed into the room.

Rachel, whats wrong? You look like you've seen a devil?

My Lady Lord Johan has died!!!

Oh, that?... Anything else of note?

My Lady??? For shame& he is your grandfather, Rachel said, looking disturbed by her mistresss cold demeanour.

Adoptive grandfather, Lucy corrected.

He took me in after my little backwater home was burnt to the ground and all those backwards idiots were crucified. I have no real blood connection to him, Lucy coldly replied.

How did he die, by the way, Lucy asked, looking up from the reports for the first time since Rachel arrived.

He was in a meeting with the other Cardinals, and they say his& Rachel shuddered at just the thought of what had happened.

Lets just say, my lady, it will be cheaper to retile the Cardinals Sanctum than it will be to clean it.

That bad, eh?

Yes, apparently, he suddenly spoke with someone elses voice, and there are talks of all-out war against the Dark Continent.

Ah, perfect, Lucy replied with a smile so cold that itd make ice insecure.

Perfect, my lady?

Yes, I cant wait to see my dearest brother and big sister again. I will be oh so happy to see their faces when I crush all they love to dust beneath my heel, Lucy passively replied as she gave a wave of her hand to dismiss Rachel.

Let me know when the Council of Grace gives me the title of Benevolence. Other than that, do not disturb me, her tone left no room for negotiation. Lucy had gotten what she wanted.

The Council of Grace was originally going to keep Johan around for a long time. The man was eternally kind-hearted, and his blessing granted him great influence far and wide. Even she had to remain cautious around him while playing the dutiful granddaughter. But the thing with his power was it wouldnt work if the person held no positive feelings for him. Despite his kindness, Lucy had always been devoid of anything nice towards him.

She was now more than ever pleased she had convinced him to make contact with her brother under the idea of convincing him to join the Theocracy. She knew her brother would see through Johan's power which he would no doubt take exception to; she had even planned for him to do something to get Johan out of the way.

Killing him, though, was something even she didnt think hed do. It had no logic to it. Perhaps she was missing data on her brother that needed to be filled. She made a mental note to get Ludo to investigate her brother further.

Lucys actions would go on to be a feat that even history books would record as magnitude beyond anything seen before or since. A secret mastermind who used the title Lord of Strings manipulated all so she could rise to power unopposed.

Lucy herself was especially fond of her pseudonym. It was very fitting; she could tug little threads using gleamed information. Much like the butterfly that causes great storms, Lucy could cause great chaos with the right words in the right ears.

You might not know me as I am not a regular on this subreddit, in fact, I was very sceptical by all the elaborate theories so I never bothered to take an actual look at the numbers.

Over the past few years Ive been trading Bobby on and off and I will admit I played both directions, as I never believed in the fundamental story.

Until recently that is, when the capital restructuring announced by management perked up my ears and I believed it was time to do an actual, real fundamental valuation for the company to see if any deep value exists at the current prices (Spoilers: holy shit I was wrong to doubt).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After some extensive digging in the earnings reports and some manual forecasting of earnings Ive come up with a small discounted cash flow (DCF) model Id like to share with you all.

Please find the TL;DR at the bottom if you do not wish to engage in a long read or dont simply don't want to waste any time.

Estimates are based on my best guesses and comparisons to historic earnings reports during the glory years

Several other, more difficult to gauge assumptions, were based on best guesses where I try to provide a:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Best-case** ;

**Economically worst case** ; and a

**Long-term equilibrium state**

Inherently these assumptions are uncertain, so you are free to copy the numbers and run some projections of yourself.

Everyones guess is equally valid and yours could differ greatly from mine, but it is important for the first step to stay realistic and not make too many market-structure related assumptions (i.e., short squeeze potential) when we are just trying to gauge the fundamental value here.

Very few analyses allow for inclusion of positive or tail-risk events (like a potential short squeeze) in a fundamental valuation.

Even so, as I (and so do most of you Im assuming) believe this is, in fact, a fundamentally positive value factor which must be included, you could place the results of the entire DCF into a probability tree model whereby you yourself can change the probability of a squeeze occurring and its corresponding value yourself

# 2. General DCF assumptions

Fair value is based on the assumption that a company is worth nothing more and nothing less than the total sum of discounted dividends returned to investors over its lifetime.

Under discounted, it is meant that a dividend returned in the future is worth less than one returned to investors now, and the difference should reflect the risk of those cashflows not materializing.

Cashflows returned to investors under the form of dividends is considered an outdated assumption, because modern companies often return capital to investors through other means such as buybacks (which BBBY did for a while during its lifetime as well)

Knowledgeable investors therefore assume the free cash flow (FCF), which represents the **total potential amount of dividends that could theoretically be returned to investors** is a more accurate metric to represent value.

Investors should therefore look at a company not from the perspective of net profits but rather the potentially optimal way to generate cash.

Notwithstanding there is a lot of debt to take into account, we can easily take this into our model by assuming wise corporate financing decision by management such as debt buybacks at depressed market values, funded with the initial cashflows.

Generally a model will assume both the current course of management/capital structure and the potential best case, but because of the recent direction management has announced, I feel vindicated of taking the shortcut of only looking at the best case.

# 3. Assumptions of changes in capital structure 

Everyone is probably aware by now that the bonds are trading at very depressed levels even after the interest payment recently has blown away the potential bankruptcy risk, which gives Bobby a significant advantage.

Very little capital is actually needed to close out the remaining debt by buying back the bonds in the open market.

Every analyst and MSM article seems hung up on the $1.8billion in debt outstanding, but fails to acknowledge that the longer term bonds can be bought back by the company at pennies on the dollar!

Roughly estimating the outstanding allocation between the 2024, 2034 and 2044 bonds (20% 2024, 20% 2034 and 60% 2044 bonds) allows us to use **mark-to-market accounting** to value this debt at its real market value, rather than the original face value.

You probably think this makes a lot of sense, after all, why would BBBY pay back debt at $1 when investors are happy to take 13 cents on the dollar?

Thanks to mark-to-market accounting we can revalue this debt **from $1.8 billion to a mere $300 million** by assuming a price of 30 cents on the 2024 bonds and 13 cents for the others (current market prices).

Honestly, the debt overhang suddenly doesnt look like much of an issue anymore which is why I was sceptical of this approach at first, but it turns out theyre already engaging in this exact approach as hidden on page 14 of their \[most recent 10-Q:\](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0000886158-23-000026)

*In November 2022, the Company completed privately negotiated exchange offers with existing holders of approximately $69.0 million, $15.3 million, and $70.2 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes, 2034 Notes, and 2044 Notes, respectively*

Now suddenly very little equity needs to be raised to completely eliminate the debt overhang, the total amount of which will form my best case versus my economic worst case short term for this model.

Going off of a small increase in outstanding share equivalent to the amount required to pay off this debt in its entirely we can discount futures cashflows as entirely attributable to shareholders!

# 4. The DCF

By eliminating the debt overhang I believe the company could gradually return to a healthy sales number equivalent to the 2018 level over a period of 5 years and remain growing at 3% as a long-term equilibrium state, which is barely above the level of inflation so I argue that's achievable.

Universal net margins would then recover to a small but healthy 4%, which is realistic and comparable to 2018 levels and amazons average margins on domestic sales over the period of (2017-2021; note: 2022 was a bad year for amazon).

The fact that debt could be eliminated greatly reduced risk and thus discount rate, which I believe we can place to just slightly above the treasury rate of 4%, thus I will assume a healthy 5% discount rate:

|Year|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|long-term|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Sales|7868|8812|9869|11053|12380|3% growth|
|Margins|\-5%|\-3%|0%|3%|4%|4%|
|FCF|\-393.4|\-264.4|0|331.6|495.2|25503.7|
|Present value|\-393.4|\-251.8|0|286.5|407.4|19031.3|

  

Fair, discounted value, calculated as the sum of the bottom row, comes out to nothing less than 19-fucking-billion dollars.

A more than 100x increase from current market cap levels.

'Course, we do have to take into account the increase in share count from the equity raise required to eliminate the debt, we have to remain realistic after all.

Taking a 2x increase in total shares outstanding if equity is raised at current levels as an **Economic worst case** we would still come out to a **fair value of $82.24 per share**.

Supposing smart management (and markets which could front run this deep value proposal), equity might be raised at higher levels than currently, potentially only leading to a 20% dilution in the **Bes-case, leading to a fair value of $137.07**.

Here is my in depth, much awaited, very data driven analysis of the top 10 lankiest players of 2022-2023.","Clearly you have all been F5ing since the day of my original post, waiting anxiously for the updated lank list. Every morning, waking up very much in the dark, stumbling helplessly through life in the vast world of the unknown where lank can only be assumed. Today that way of life ends, and you begin a life enlightened. I, your favourite lank connoisseur, have assembled a top ten list of of the current NBA's most legendary lanky danksters.

I present the 2022-2023 Lank List.

**Notes:** The last post went well, but I basically just used a wingspan to height ratio. Many people pointed out that this is really just the Ape Index, and were concerned that my list was faulty as a players girth and heft were not taken into account. As a result, some players in my top ten had very long arms for their height, but also had bodies like Kyle Lowry's booty. It was pointed out that lank also should factor in a players slinkyness, which I totally agree with.

I have created a new spreadsheet, and a new formula for calculating a player's lank which takes weight into account, and assigns coefficients to weight, height, and wingspan to prioritize each in a way that best represents lank. This took WAY too long for this stupid post, but I did it for you because I love you and hate myself.

Also, 100% Lank is the measurement of league average lank, so anything above 100% is lankier than average, and anything below is stumpier than average.

**10**  =&gt;  **Frank Ntilikina, DAL - 127% Lank**

""Lanky Franky"" Ntilikina is best known for being a fan favourite player for the New York Knicks. Understandably so, the fans saw the potential in his athleticism and unbelievable lank, I can respect it. At 6'4"", he has a whopping 7'1 wingspan, he is truly a long armed specimen. Unfortunately, his lank was squandered, and New York's optimism misguided. The Dallas Mavericks were also fooled, as they signed Lanky Franky to a 2 year deal. To his credit, he had his most efficient shooting season after signing with Dallas, nearly shooting 40% from the field. I'm sure he's a nice guy.

**9**  =&gt;  **Ryan Rollins, GSW - 128% Lank**

To be honest, I don't know much about Ryan Rollins. In fact I have never heard of him before. But after very little research, I have determined that he has elite range. That range being measured from his left fingertip to his right fingertip. He is 6'2"" with a nearly 6'10"" wingspan! If that doesn't get you excited, the dude only weighs 180 pounds! He is one long armed skinny minny, making a HUGE impact on the lank scene in his first year in the league, and in a very lanky rookie class to boot.

**8**  =&gt;  **Kelly Oubre Junior, CHA - 129% Lank**

Kelly Oubre Jr. Seems to have made a resurgence this year. The man once known as Golden State's resident inefficient chucker, is now averaging 20ppg for the Charlotte Hornets! He actually has the lowest eFG% of his career this year, but that doesn't matter. Michael Jordan doesn't have him on the floor for his efficiency. A winner like him understands the motivational boost that can be gained from playing alongside such magnificently long and slender arms. At under 6'6"" with a wingspan over 7'2"", he is truly a sight to behold.

**7**  =&gt;  **Jrue Holiday's Brother, DAL - 132% Lank**

Jrue Holiday's brother who plays for Dallas is truly remarkable, with an impressive 132% Lank! Jrue clearly got the talent, but at least Jrue Holiday's brother who plays for Dallas is an elite lankster, giving mom and dad something to be incredibly proud of. They have another brother in the NBA but he isn't notable, good at basketball, or lanky. His parents probably forgot him at the bus stop frequently as a kid.

**6**  =&gt;  **JT Thor, CHA - 133% Lank**

Strengthening my hypothesis that Michael Jordan is a lank appreciator, we find JT Thor in the #6 spot on our lanky top ten list. He is averaging under 3 points per game in over 10 minutes per game. But he is clearly on the team for his on-the-bench play, using his over 7'3"" wingspan to hand out towels, water bottles, and give high fives all over the damn place.

**5**  =&gt;  **Bol Bol, ORL - 136% Lank**

Bol Bol is the son of one the first ballot hall of lanker Manute Bol. Sharing a gene pool with the Lank God himself has left Bol Bol truly blessed. He is nearly 7'1"" with a 7'7"" wingspan, being able to reach cookies off of the highest of shelves. On top of that, he is having a breakout season with the Magic and seems to have insane highlights every night.

**4**  =&gt;  **Chris Boucher - TOR - 141% Lank**

Chris Boucher is the proud owner of the nickname ""Slim Duck"". He received this nickname because a slim duck must be quite a bit lankier than a normal duck, and Chris Boucher is quite a bit lankier than a normal NBA player. And thus Slim Duck was born. Chris Boucher is 6'9"" with a 7'4"" wingspan, which makes him the longest boi of Nick Nurse's Longboi"" lineup. Adding to his lank appeal, he weighs under 200lbs! Most of us nephews are probably a foot shorter than Chris Boucher and still weigh more than him, that feels bad.

**3**  =&gt;  **Brandon Ingram, NOP - 144% Lank**

Brandon Ingram is one of the few players on this list that is actually good at basketball. He is having a solid season posting over 22 points per game. His combination of 6'7"", 190lb frame and 7'3"" wingspan makes him a lank superstar. Standing next to his absolute girth-lord teammate Zion Williamson, he looks like a pipecleaner without the fluffy bits. Perfection.

**2**  =&gt;  **Mo Bamba, ORL (edit: actually LAL apparently oops) - 145% Lank**

Mo ""Arms Than You"" Bamba is Orlando's second representative on this top ten list, and oh boy is this guy an absolute beast of a human being. He is the heaviest on the top ten list at a weight of 230lbs, which in order to conquer this illustrious list of lank would mean he must have some REDICULOUS proportions. He is 6'11"", and has a wingspan of 7'11"", which would give him the longest wingspan in the nba! If he was not a successful NBA player, he could fall back on being a road closure barricade, hug contractor, or as a measuring tape for fish that are 7'11"" long.

**1**  =&gt;  **Chet Holmgren, OKC - 150% Lank**

And with the number one pick in the draft, u/Jimmeratemypasta selects Chet ""195 lbs soaking wet"" Holmgren, from the University of Gonzaga. How can I not, with a ludicrous 150% lank! He is the human embodiment of a giraffe's leg, the ideal male form. The Oklahoma City Thunder clearly have a type, and that type is tall men with bird skeletons. Poku was impressive, but Chet is on another level. He is 7'0"" tall with a 7'6"" wingspan, and weights only 195lbs! To nobody's surprise, his driftwood bones have already broken. But for the sake of all that is long and thin I pray that this man has a successful recovery. He has potential to be an absolute legend in the lank game, I can't wait to see what the 2023-2024 season holds for him.

**BONUS:**

For every long limbed beauty strutting his stuff, there is a stumpy lumpkin waddling his way down the court. These bottom 10 short limbed t-rexes are my dishonorable mentions. Welcome to the hall of shame gentlemen.

9  =&gt;  Dennis Smith Jr., CHA - 78% Lank

8  =&gt;  Mason Plumlee, CHA - 77% Lank

7  =&gt;  Fred VanVleet, TOR - 77% Lank

6  =&gt;  Dario Saric, OKC - 77% lank

5  =&gt;  Jusuf Nurkic, POR - 75% Lank

4  =&gt;  Desmond Bane, MEM - 74% Lank

And are there some who can survive infection unharmed without medical intervention? Medical Mystery","Rabies is a disease which terrifies people - and for good reason. The rabies virus (scientific name *Rabies lyssavirus*) is a single-stranded RNA virus which can be carried by any warm-blooded mammal, although some are much more susceptible than others. It exists in over 150 countries and on five continents (Antarctica is of course clear, but Oceania also hosts no rabies virus, only related lyssaviruses). The virus travels along the nerves of the host until it reaches the brain, causing physical and behavioural symptoms and, before too long, death.

# Background - The Science of Rabies

Rabies is a **disease**, a set of symptoms and signs affecting a person. It is most commonly caused by the rabies virus, but the same signs and symptoms can also come with infection from other, closely related, lyssaviruses. Think of it like the common cold - multiple similar viruses produce the same outcome for the people or animals infected. Because the disease was named and described well before we even knew what a virus was, and because treatment and prognosis is often the same, it doesn't serve us well to split it up further.

Research is ongoing as to where and when rabies originated. Currently, most fingers are pointing at [bats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123870407000123?via%3Dihub) as the source animal. This isn't actually surprising - bats make up 25% of all mammal species, they live in large and densely populated colonies, and they have an incredibly powerful and effective immune system which stops them from getting sick much of the time. With the SARS-CoV2 pandemic of 2019 onwards, there has been increased study in this area, and some [interesting results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025585/).

But researchers are still uncertain of the when or the where. Estimates of the age of lyssaviruses still range widely, with research on the rabies virus specifically indicating that it a sort of rabies virus may have evolved in bats in [around 5000 BCE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5231386/), with current carnivora strains dating back [888 to 1,459 years](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC115054/) (542 CE to 1113 CE). But historical evidence (I'll discuss that shortly) exists for rabies in dogs some 4,000 years before present, indicating that there have been multiple, possibly even many, times that the virus has spilled over from bats to carnivora (dogs, foxes, raccoons, etc).

Bats are still the main hosts of lyssaviruses worldwide, and most of the viruses have so far only been found in bats. The rabies virus is the exception; it is able to infect many different mammal species, and in laboratory environments has been shown to be able to infect birds, as well as cell cultures of birds, reptiles and insects. But its main hosts are bats (still) and members of the mammal order *Carnivora*, especially the *caniforms* \- dogs, raccoons, foxes, skunks, wolves and coyotes - but also cats and mongooses.

(Opossums, because of their lower body temperature, are also resistant to rabies. Smaller animals such as rabbits/hares and rodents generally do not survive the sort of bite that would infect them.)

Rabies infection occurs when the saliva of an infected animal gets into an open wound, mucus membrane (nose, mouth), or the eyes. The virus enters the host's cells and multiples. What makes lyssaviruses unusual, however, is that they are **neurotropic**, meaning they can infect nerve cells - something which (luckily) relatively few viruses are capable of doing. Because nerve cells (specifically axons) are so long, they have mechanisms for moving resources along them (axonal transport), and rabies takes advantage of this to move, slowly and inexorably, towards the brain.

This movement makes up the incubation period of the virus. It has been recorded as taking as little as seven days, or as much as six years, but usually takes one to two months. Along the way, it might cause pain with no obvious cause, but often has no symptoms at all.

On reaching the brain and meninges (the membranes around the brain), the rabies virus begins to multiple in earnest. The first symptoms are usually a high fever (up to 107°F or 41.7°C) and headaches. As the disease progresses, it causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and/or meningitis (inflammation of the meninges), which can cause confusion, agitation, paranoia, hallucinations, anxiety or feelings of terror, or even partial paralysis. Finally, the disease progresses to delirium (acute confusion), coma, and death. Death generally occurs between 2 and 10 days in carnivora or human hosts.

Agitation and fear are seen in around 80% of carnivora (and human) infections; this is called ""furious rabies"". The remaining 20% are called ""dumb rabies"", which causes loss of sensation, muscle weakness, and eventual paralysis which also leads to coma and death. This form of rabies is not the one most people recognise, and may be underreported.

The famous symptom of apparent hydrophobia (fear of water) in humans in fact comes from an inability to swallow - when attempting to do so, the throat spasms and tightens. This also prevents the host from swallowing their own saliva, leading to drooling and foaming at the mouth.

The rabies virus also enters the salivary glands, where it reproduces in great numbers and is expressed into saliva. Agitation and other effects of the encephalitis regularly cause aggressive behaviour including biting. And so the cycle continues.

# Background - The History of Rabies

Rabies (in particular ""furious rabies"") is a distinctive disease, and despite the relatively long incubation period it seems that people figured out early on how the disease was passed on.

Dogs have been with humans for tens of thousands of years. They diverged from wolves around 38,000 to 18,000 BCE; there are disputed archaeological finds from 34,000 BCE and secure ones from 12,200 BCE. But throughout the historical record there has been a distinction between domestic pets and working dogs - appreciated, respected, even loved - and dangerous feral dog populations that were associated with disease, death, and carrion. And it seems that rabies was part of the reason for that fear.

Eshnunna was a city-state in Mesopotamia which was inhabited from around 3000 BCE to 1600 BCE. Throughout its existence, it was considered part of various empires (Sumerian, Akkadian, Subartuan), but city-states always retained some autonomy and were able to create their own laws. A pair of stone tablets known as the Laws of Eshnunna, dating to c. 1770 BCE (with copies citing a source from c. 1930 BCE) say

    If a dog becomes rabid and the ward authority makes that known to its owner, but he does not watch over his dog so that it bites a man and causes his death, the owner of the dog shall pay forty shekels of silver; if it bites a slave and causes his death, he shall pay fifteen shekels of silver.

The word ""rabid"" has also been translated as ""furious"" or ""vicious"", but the distinctive feature of the bite makes it likely this does refer to rabies. Various ""incantations"" (written forms of spoken incantations or prayers) against or regarding dog bites with ""venom"" are [attested to](https://brill.com/display/book/9789004496293/B9789004496293_s017.xml) from the same period.

This is the oldest known historical evidence of rabies, but far from the only one. The *Su[rata samhita*, an Ayurvedic medicinal text likely written between 1 and 200 CE (but heavily edited somewhere between 500 and 1000 CE, and yet reputedly collecting the wisdom of an ancestor who lived in 1000 BCE or earlier) gives a detailed description of the symptoms of rabies in carnivora or in humans, recognises hydrophobia as a uniquely human symptom, and a sign that the disease will be fatal.

In Ancient Greece, rabies was called *lyssa*, the word also used as a metaphor for inhuman bouts of rage among mythic heroes. Aristotle (384-322 BCE) thought that humans (and perhaps elephants) were immune to rabies. A series of writers show an improved knowledge - Aulus Cornelius Celcus, Themison, Eudemus - until eventually the physician Soranus of Epheseus (fl. 1st or 2nd century BCE) gave detailed descriptions of symptoms and stated firmly that once symptoms appeared, the disease progression was short.

The Babylonian Talmud (written c. 500 CE, or 4260 in the Hebrew Calendar, and edited for another couple of centuries) [references attempted treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1081547/pdf/medhist00119-0100.pdf), but elsewhere says that rabies is always fatal and that a rabid dog is one of five animals so dangerous that it is permitted to kill one even on the Sabbath.

Saint Hubertus, or Saint Hubert, c. 656 to 727 CE, was said to have cured a man with rabies. He was declared a saint in 1744, with this cure considered to be one of his miracles (acknowledging that rabies was incurable at the time). He is not the only saint said to have cured someone of rabies, but he became the best known and the patron saint of rabies sufferers. Into the twentieth century, ""St. Hubert's Key"" was tried for a cure - a bar, nail or cross used to prick the forehead of the person, then heated and placed where the bite had occurred.

Writers on medicine from the Islamic Empire - al-Rz+, Ibn S+na and Ibn Zuhr - wrote on rabies with mixed accuracy. Jewish philosopher and physician Moses Maimonides was more correct, identifying that symptom onset might be delayed by a month, and that by the time symptoms appeared there was nothing that could be done. In this, he was correct - more than three thousand years since it was first mentioned in writing, there was still no treatment for rabies.

It was not until the twentieth century, with the development of vaccines for humans and dogs (see below) that human infection from bats could truly be identified. Spanish colonist Oveido (in full  Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés) wrote in 1535 about ""poisonous"" vampire bat bites, and by the early 20th century it was known that vampire bats fed of cattle and this was rumoured to cause ""peste de cadeiras"" (lit. plague of chairs) where cattle would lose power over and sit on their hindquarters, salivate excessively, and eventually die to ascending paralysis. But it was not until 1916 when an epidemiological study indicated vampire bat and a fruit bat was positively diagnosed with the disease.

&amp;#x200B;

# Background - Vaccine and Cure

Louis Pasteur began his research into rabies in 1880. Unable to isolate the virus - because it was smaller and less stable than a bacterium - he and colleague Emile Roux instead used brain tissue from a rabid dog to infect another dog, then to infect a series of rabbits (which were easier and safer to handle). They removed and dried spinal cord tissue from these rabbits to attenuate (weaken) the rabies virus.

This tissue, with attenuated virus, was then injected into dogs. The dogs were then exposed to rabies, but none fell sick. In July 1885, a nine-year-old boy called Joseph Meister was brought to Pasteur, having been bitten fourteen times by a rabid dog. Knowing that each bite was an exposure, and that if infected the boy was certain to die, Pasteur and a physician friend Dr. Grancher worked together to inoculate Meister 13 times in 10 days with increasingly less attenuated (and thus more virulent) spiral cord material. Meister did not develop rabies. In September 1885, a 15-year-old shepherd named Jean-Baptiste Jupille was also treated after being bitten by a rabid dog whom he restrained to let his friends escape. He also did not develop rabies, and this time Pasteur spoke publicly about the treatment.

Within weeks, people were flocking to Pasteur from across Europe to be treated - and if they reached him before developing symptoms, they could be. Pasteur opened a vaccination clinic by December, which also acted as a research and teaching centre.

Pasteur also developed a very similar vaccine for use in dogs, allowing for animal vaccinations and preventing the spread of disease. In some places it was fantastically successful - within thirty years, for example, there was no rabies virus in the British Isles, and to this day only a small wild bat population has a related lyssavirus.

Similar vaccines of attenuated nerve tissue are still used in some parts of the world today, as they are cheaper and easier to produce, requiring only relatively simple equipment and being stable to transport. However, they are not as effective as later forms of vaccine, and can still have a risk of developing rabies if the virus was not sufficiently attenuated.

In the time since Pasteur, seven successful vaccines have been developed - two using nerve tissue, one using virus grown in duck embryonic cells and then killed before injection, and then four using virus grown in cell culture and then killed before injection. In all cases, people who are believed to have been exposed to rabies are given four (if not previously vaccinated) or two (if previously vaccinated) injections.

At least as important was the developing use of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). RIG can be collected from humans or from horses (horses produce more, but the RIG has a slightly higher chance of a reaction such as pain or swelling) who have been given a rabies vaccine and produced a high number of antibodies as a result. These antibodies are collected and given as soon as possible to people who have been exposed to rabies. RIG and vaccine together can produce a [99%-100% protection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781455748013003210) against developing rabies.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Unsurvivable

That 99%-100% protection rate has one major caveat: the RIG has to be given as soon as possible, and the vaccine *must* be given before symptoms start. Even in the 21st century, once a patient starts to show neurological symptoms it is game over - once the virus reaches the brain, the immune system has lost.

Rabies is estimated to cause between 40,000 and 60,000 deaths a year. Around 80% of these deaths are in Asia, with another 15% in Africa. Over 40% of the deaths are in children under the age of 15, likely due to a number of factors including lack of education and awareness, physical vulnerability, and how children enjoy playing and exploring wilder areas.

It is estimated that 99% of human rabies cases worldwide are caused by dogs. However, in the Americas this is reversed, and almost all cases are caused by bat bites. Bat bites are smaller, with people sometimes not even realising that they have been bitten, which can lead to a delay in treatment - and as we've seen, with rabies it is all about the delay.

# The Survivors

Before I list known survival cases, I want to make a note about the vaccine that I think could be important here. The rabies vaccine is highly unusual in being given *after* exposure (except for some individuals in high-risk jobs who may be proactively vaccinated), and it works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies *work* \- what the vaccine does is get them into production before the virus has time to reach the brain. RIG is an even more immediate way of doing this. So the vaccine shows that the human body has the capability to counter the rabies virus in certain circumstances - it's just that those circumstances have to be carefully controlled.

1. In 1970 in Ohio, US, a 6-year-old boy named Matthew Winkler was woken on October 10 by a bat biting his thumb. He was taken to the doctor and given vaccination - but not RIG. By October 30 he developed neck pain, then fever and dizziness; by November 4 he was in hospital. He became markedly uncooperative, developed muscle weakness and cardiac irregularities, and entered a coma. By the end of the month, he had exited it, was sitting up and making deliberate sounds, and over the following weeks began to speak and to walk again. With speech and physical therapy, he was discharged from the hospital on January 21 1971, deemed ""normal in both voice and intellect"". In their write-up, his clinicians concluded that ""aggressive supportive care"" was the only significant factor they could see for the boy's survival. ([Case report](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-76-6-931) \- Annals of Internal Medicine)
2. In 1972, a 45-year-old woman in Argentina was bitten by a dog which died shortly afterwards. She began a course of vaccines, but before completing it developed tingling in her arm, fever and weakness. Despite remaining very ill for some 75 days, she later made a ""nearly complete"" recovery by September 1973. ([Case report](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/0003-4819-85-1-44) \- Annals of Internal Medicine)
3. In 1977, a 32-year-old laboratory worker in New York was infected when he inhaled modified live virus being aerosolised by a faulty piece of laboratory equipment. The worker had been fully vaccinated some years previously and received annual boosters, but developed symptoms and was in a coma for some days before beginning recovery. There is not much available on this case. ([Case report](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/221447/WER5230_247-248.PDF) \- WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report)
4. In August 1992, a 9-year-old boy in Mexico was severely bitten by a rabid dog. He was given vaccination, but no RIG, and began to develop symptoms shortly afterwards. He spent time in a coma and on a ventilator, but after approximately one month began to show signs of increased awareness. He recovered the ability to breath on his own, and later to eat, and his original quadriplegia was starting to show signs of improvement (in the form of involuntary muscle movements) by the time the report was published in December 1994. However, this has been described as a ""partial recovery"" only, and he clearly faced severe effects. ([Case report](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Citation/1994/12000/PARTIAL_RECOVERY_FROM_RABIES_IN_A_NINE_YEAR_OLD.20.aspx) \- Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal)
5. In 2001, a 6-year-old girl in India had been bitten by a street dog. 20 days later, showing neurological symptoms, she was hospitalised and given the rabies vaccine (but no RIG). She was at first semi-conscious and somewhat responsive, but entered into a coma shortly afterwards. She remained in a coma for three months, then spent another three months in hospital before discharge. This is again described as a ""partial recovery"". ([Case report](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(02)90144-X/fulltext) \- International Journal for Infectious Diseases)
6. In October 2004, a 15-year-old girl named Jeanna Giese was hospitalised with fatigue, vomiting, vision disturbances, and lack of coordination. She was soon sedated and intubated (given a breathing tube), and after it was revealed she had been bitten by a bat about four weeks before she was tested for rabies. It was positive. Dr. Rodney Willoughby, who had been put in charge of her care, created an experimental plan involving sedation and broad-spectrum antivirals. She was in a coma for a week, then gradually regained consciousness and physical control. She went home, in a wheelchair, on January 1 2005, and underwent two years of intensive physical therapy to learn from scratch how to walk and talk. In 2011, she graduated university with a degree in biology (studying the fungal diseases of bats) and maintains social media handles to support rabies awareness. She married Scott Frassetto in 2014 (she is often now listed as Jeanna Giese-Frassetto) and gave birth to twins in 2016 and a third child in 2018. She is considered the first person to have survived rabies without any vaccine treatment; the treatment used for her is now called the **Milwaukee Protocol**; a later modification is called the **Recife Protocol**.
7. Four more individuals treated with the Milwaukee Protocol between 2004 and 2012 managed partial recoveries. Three of them survived, but with profound neurological disabilities; a fourth survived rabies but passed away due to pneumonia before regaining consciousness.
8. In 2009, a 17-year-old girl attended the hospital with fever, photophobia and pain, and on explaining that she had come into contact with bats two months earlier while camping was tested for the rabies virus. She was given RIG and one dose of vaccine (there were concerns that more doses would be too much for her immune system) and, while hospitalised, never became seriously ill. She seems to have been fully recovered within one month. ([Case report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5907a1.htm) \- CDC)
9. In 2011, an 8-year-old girl named Precious Reynolds from California (Reynolds is Wiyot Native American) was hospitalised following a fight with a feral cat some four weeks earlier. After a week in a coma, she awoke and made a rapid recovery, leaving hospital after only seven weeks with a slight limp and an ankle brace.
10. In 2012, a 4-year-old boy in South Africa was bitten by a rabid dog, and within three weeks was hospitalised showing symptoms of rabies. The boy had been vaccinated, but not received RIG. On discharge the patient was described as ""semi-conscious"" and remained bedbound at the time of the article in 2014. ([Case report](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23120053.2016.1128151) \- Southern African Journal of Infectious Diseases)
11. Between 2013-5, six cases of survival have been reported in India; five show significant neurological problems but one, a 13-year-old girl named Sarika, is reported to have made a full recovery. ([Local newspaper article](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/45-days-after-rabies-attack-teen-survives/articleshow/45815352.cms); [case report](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(15)00112-5/fulltext) of one of the other cases - International Journal of Infectious Disease)

In 1972, likely inspired by Matthew Winkler, Doege and Northrup published in the Lancet a list of [nine cases of reported recovery](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(74)91084-8/fulltext) from rabies between 1875 and 1968. Unfortunately, since none of these were confirmed in a laboratory as rabies virus (or any lyssavirus) we will never quite be sure of them.

It seems that there are only between 20 and 30 documented cases of people surviving rabies once the symptoms of the infection have started to appear. Around one-third seem to have managed a full or nearly full recovery, but the rest have moderate to significant symptoms and some have been left profoundly disabled. The Milwaukee protocol has also been far from a silver bullet - by 2012, out of 35 cases treated with the Milwaukee protocol, 6 had survived, with 2 making near-full recoveries. (In 2013, with 41 cases, [it was still only 6](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/is_rabies_really_100_fatal/).) This is a small sample size to be working with - but for a disease previously believed to be 100% fatal, it is still one final chance.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Hidden Cases?

But there is another aspect of rabies survival which has only more recently been documented. The history of rabies has traditionally had two significant stages - exposure and symptom onset. If a patient did not develop symptoms, it is presumed that either they were not infected, or that in the modern day they were protected by RIG and/or vaccines.

But could this be a logical fallacy, based on our assumption that rabies is always symptomatic? In 2010, a CDC team surveyed two villages in Perú and found rabies virus antibodies in 7 out of the 63 individuals tested. Only 1 of these 7 had a history of vaccination. 6 out of the 7, however, reported having been bitten by a bat at some point - and remember how, above, bat bites aren't always noticeable. ([Report](https://web.archive.org/web/20120804185302/https://www.ajtmh.org/content/87/2/206.full) \- Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, via Wayback Machine)

It was even noted that the level of antibodies seemed to increase with age, which some suggested was due to repeated low-level exposures over the years - exposures so small that the immune system could handle them.

Something which might matter here is the **infectious dose**. This refers to how many of a pathogen are needed to reliably infect a new host - in *E. coli* this may be as few as 100 bacteria, whereas *Salmonella* seems to need more like 1,000 bacteria. The problem is that for rabies, the infectious dose is considered unknown, even today! This is likely because it is considered so dangerous, so deadly, that experiments to find out are unethical or impossible.

Equally, however, it may be possible that rabies virus or other lyssaviruses can cause **asymptomatic infections** or symptoms which do not require hospitalisation - influenza can cause a fortnight of headaches and fever without even getting into its more severe complications, but the 2009 rabies case documented above, for example, does not seem to go significantly beyond this. Might there be infections that the body catches before it enters the nerves?

Several scientists note that the Perú study exclusively relates to bat rabies virus, and that Matthew Winkler, Jeanna Giese, the 2009 patient and Precious Reynolds were all infected by bats or a cat - only Sarika, in 2015, recovered from a dog infection. Since genetic evidence suggested that current strains of canine rabies split from bat rabies hundreds of years ago, it may be that bat rabies is less virulent, or that bats shed less infectious material (and thus case a smaller dose). It is not known whether the cat that infected Precious Reynolds was infected with canine rabies or with bat rabies.

The 2010 CDC study did not indicate that they had reason to believe that there was any genetic aspect to potential resistance to rabies, but it wouldn't be the only time such a genetic quirk would appear. More than 95% of people are naturally immune to Hansen's disease (formerly known as leprosy); 1% of people descended from Northern Europeans (especially Swedes) are highly resistant to HIV infection due to [a mutation called CCR5-delta 32](https://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/viruses101/hiv_resistant_mutation/) which makes it impossible for HIV to enter immune cells - and may have arisen because it would also have made it impossible for *smallpox* to enter immune cells. With so much of the human genome not yet understood, is it possible that there has been a selection pressure to protect against rabies or - probably more likely - against some other disease that has left protection against rabies in its wake?

&amp;#x200B;

# A Final Thought

For nearly twenty years, since the Milwaukee Protocol was developed, there have been arguments about its effectiveness and about whether it should be improved, scrapped, or excoriated on the public stage as a fallacy for the twenty-first century as severe as radium water or bloodletting. Supporters point out that it gives a chance of survival to those who otherwise have none, and the parents of Jeanna Giese said that they hoped she would be the first to survive but that even if she wasn't, they hoped doctors could learn how to better treat rabies. Detractors point out that it is extremely expensive, invasive, and that the majority of survivors still have profound disabilities afterwards.

Dr. Thiravat Hemachudha and Dr. Henry Wilde, highly-respected neurologists and vocal sceptics, point out that there is also a danger to making rabies seem ""survivable"" - for as long as it is known as fatal, people do not have an excuse to kid themselves into missing out on immediate treatment. More than that, they state that the cost of treating one patient under the Milwaukee protocol would cover something like 16,000 preventative vaccinations.

But if preventative vaccinations have been missed, and the person is already showing symptoms, the Milwaukee protocol is perhaps the last chance remaining of life - and that is a hard achievement to argue against.

# Outstanding Questions

* When and where did lyssaviruses in general, and the rabies virus in particular, evolve?
* Are there likely other cases of people surviving symptomatic rabies, without treatment, buried in history?
* Are there asymptomatic or sub-clinical (ie minor) cases which we don't notice in the shadow of fatal ones?
* Have bat rabies and canine rabies diverged so much that it makes a clinical difference which one a human is infected with?
* Could there be a genetic component to resistance?
* Is the Milwaukee benefit of so slender a chance of success that it should be refuted or rethought? Is it relevant that it was developed on a bat rabies case, when 99% of cases worldwide are canine?
* How do some people recover fully in short times, while others need years, and many continue to have profound neurological effects to the present day?

The system had been wiped out three times. Once by a Lanaktallan bioweapon attack. Then by the Terran Xenocide Event. Finally, by the phasic shades. Around the gas giants the massive matter mining platforms still worked, the automation of Mantid make, some of the best in the universe. The asteroid belt mining systems chuckled and kept on working, keeping the mass tanks and the rare element storage topped off. The solar collectors around the stellar mass collected energy and beamed it in tight hyperwave to the receiving stations further out in the stellar system. The Oort Cloud was silent, blameless, comets and other debris of a stellar system forming filling it.

There was a single planet in the green zone. Two thousand years ago it had been nothing but a barren rock. An Elven Court had xenoformed the planet into a lush green world with sparkling blue oceans, islands, and four continents.

The weather satellites were less to keep any harsh weather from occurring and more to keep the environment, weather, and ecology stable. They kept on with their automated programming, ensuring that the weather could be predicted by those with the esoteric knowledge and record keeping ability. They all had several channels to listen for request from groundside for beings of enough power and knowledge to call upon the weather.

Forests, deserts, jungle, badlands, all of the terrain types were present on the planet. Where normal xenoforming worked to ensure the planet was as comfortable as possible, with smooth, even terrain that allowed for maximum utilization, the planet's was pseudo-natural, leaving vast sections of the terrain harsh wilderness.

The ship dropped out of Ghostspace with a flare of the jumpcore. It waited until the sensors cleared, then began listening for any perimeter buoys.

Captain Kent Kal&lt;pop&gt;kitikak stood on the bridge as the data slowly made its way to the screen in front of him. In days past, the communications would have been virtually instant, but the safeguards against ghosts slowed everything down.

The buoy system had received the emergency update. It transmitted in text only.

\[PRESENT PROOF OF LIFE\] was all it stated.

Captain Kent Kal&lt;pop&gt;kitikak's communications specialist, a Rigellian female, sang a quick song and transferred it.

\[PROOF OF LIFE ACCEPTED\] the system replied. There was a moment. \[THIS SYSTEM IF PROPERTY OF LYFETEK INDUSTRIES. PLEASE READ AND ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\]

Captain Kent waited for the massive document to be transferred. He transferred two copies to his passengers, then waited for his junker's guild lawyer to go over it.

It took nearly two days before the lawyer signed it, had Kent sign it, then transmitted it and the two passenger's versions back to the buoy.

It was standard biolerplate. He agreed not to hold Lyfetek Industries OmniCorps Negative Liability Company at fault for any damages to the ship, cargo, passengers, or crew under a bunch of different terms.

He also agreed not to go any further than the highlighted space station around the single planet in the green zone, not to disembark anyone but the passengers that had signed the terms and conditions, as well as having agreed not to make any video, audio, or still photography media of the planet or its inhabitants.

Captain Kent Kal&lt;pop&gt;kitikak informed his two adult passengers that the ship was moving in-system to dock with the space station. He then looked at his scanner technicians.

""Life signs?"" he asked.

The scan-tech shook his head. ""Some pretty heavy anti-scanning tech, but the long range sensors can't find any higher life forms that fit the standard database,"" he said. ""Lots of lower life forms and millions of anomalous life forms.""

""It's a LARP world,"" the Rigellian communications specialist stated. ""There's a lot of Born Whole mythological creatures and fantasy creatures down there.""

Captain Kent nodded. ""Let our passengers know they have six hours till we'll be in range of the station to get final approach instructions.""

She nodded, touching her ear.

Captain Kent stared at the planet. It was inside the Confederacy, in the old Terran Systems. Closer to the Core Worlds and the Inner Sphere than it was to the Border Worlds and the Fringe Systems. Most of the worlds around it had been standard manufacturing and agri-corps worlds, four fifths of them automated worlds that provided 'real food' and 'real elements' for higher end manufacturing.

He planned on checking them out, seeing if there was anything good for salvage.

He had no idea why anyone would want to live on what looked to be an abandoned world.

But his passengers were Terrans, and the operative part of the nickname The Mad Lemurs of Terra was the simple word ""Mad"" as far as he was concerned.

\-----

The space station looked more like a fairy castle sitting on a cloud than anything high tech. Lots of sparkling, lights, and delicate construction. Lots of crystal, rare metals, rare elements, and other esoteric decorations. The 'cloud' was pointed 'down' at the planet surface.

Captain Kent Kal&lt;pop&gt;kitikak figured it was to keep anyone on the ground from seeing it.

He stared at the text on the screen even as his ship locked into the umbilical.

\[FOUR PLAYERS ARRIVING/ZERO PLAYERS LEAVING\]

\[FIRMWARE UPDATES ACCEPTED: ELE OVERRIDE\]

\[NO CARGO TO BE TRANSFERRED\]

\[NO CREW R&amp;R AVAILABLE\]

He sighed and shook his head.

""Our passengers are leaving,"" his commo-tech said.

Captain Kent just nodded. ""Thank them for their assistance in Ghostspace,"" he said.

The commo-tech nodded.

""They're away. The station is demanding we disengage and leave the system. Refueling, re-massing, is available at a single Oort Cloud station,"" the commo tech said.

Kent looked at his navigator and his pilot, both beings busy.

""Just take us to Ghostspace,"" he said. He looked at the fairy-castle again. ""Good luck,"" he said to his disembarked passengers.

""We're clear for Ghostspace transfer,"" his astrogator said.

""Take us out.""

The massive cargo ship sparkled and vanished.

The system went back to silence.

\-----

The tall, muscular, brown skinned woman stepped into the scanner, letting the lasers play over her bare skin. Next to her a pale skinned man stepped into a different scanner.

""Just let the scanner go over you,"" a tall, pale, beautiful figure on the other side of the scanning system said, her voice lyrical and lovely. On either side of her stood two smaller versions of herself, each of them holding a small brown skinned baby that watched. One was frowning, the other was smiling and chewing on its own fist.

Both adults stood for a while.

""Scan complete,"" the elven woman stated. She smiled. ""Both of you are compatible with Lyftek Industries LARP MMORPG systems. Genetic anomalies are within acceptable parameters.""

""Thank you, ancient one,"" the woman said, stepping forward at the silent instructions that appeared in her vision. She strutted as if she was clad in finery rather than completely nude.

The male just grunted, covering his crotch with both hands as he shuffled forward. The woman glanced and laughed.

""So modest, Space Force?"" she asked.

""Just weird,"" the man answered.

The elven woman waved and holographic clothing covered both adults in a skin tight bodysuit.

""Follow,"" she said, turning and leading further into the station.

""This is weird,"" the male said.

""Standard inprocessing for a full LARP world,"" the woman said.

The couple was led through the station, looking at various data screens. They were shown various scenes. From bucolic hamlets to large farms to exciting video of people fighting monsters and mages throwing magic.

At last, the elven women turned and faced the pair of adults. ""Beyond here, you choose your lifepath and personal history options.""

""We have already chosen married couple with two children, no resheathing, no rebirth,"" the woman said.

The Elven woman nodded. ""That will limit your character start options.""

The human woman smiled. ""Of course.""

""Your weapons and armor will have 'heritage' tags applied to them. Will you prefer skillsoft downloads as well as muscle memory implantation or wash?"" the Elven woman asked.

""Standard character generation selection for implantation, wash, or downloads, please,"" the human woman smiled.

The Elven woman nodded, pointing at a set of two dozen reclining chairs. ""Please, have a seat. We will link you so that you may make your choices.""

The woman and man moved over and sat down, reclining next to one another. The elven women put the babies on their chests.

""Your cybernetics are within parameters and need no upgrade or removal,"" the Elf woman said. ""Datalinks and retinal links are permittable.""

She pointed at the male. ""You will need a bioforge implantation.""

The male nodded. ""Understood.""

""Please, begin,"" the elf said.

The two adults nodded.

The male closed his eyes. There was a flicker and the text appeared in his vision. Standard terms and conditions he speed-read most of then clicked ""ACCEPT"".

He felt a cold feeling on his chest and knew that the gene-seeds for the bio-engineered organ were being injected into his chest.

\[ALTER RACE?\]

He clicked no. No on changing sex, no on changing appearance.

\[STATUS: MARRIED, TWO CHILDREN - TWINS\] appeared.

Then was a short list of 'beginning life paths' that streamed by.

Most of them were blurred out.

""Query,"" he asked.

""Yes?"" The elven woman's voice was calm and collected.

""There are no real community choices available,"" he said. ""Why?""

There was silence. ""Mass die-off of customers. Born Whole systems are currently on standby. Do you wish to engage in full village reconstruction?""

""Kay?"" the man asked.

""Yes. Full Born Whole community construction. Random location, beginner difficulty area. Preferably woodland with light to moderate hills and nearby mountains. Preferable large water sources. Outskirts of major active or extensive fallen nation,"" the woman said, not opening her eyes.

""This will require memory implantation for full community interaction,"" the Elf warned.

The man clicked the box to accept.

Again, the beginning life paths streamed up. Most were blurred, still.

""What do I take?"" he asked the woman.

""Whatever you choose,"" she said. He could hear the smile in her voice. ""I am choosing your humble wife. Caregiver, child-bearer, housekeeper, domestic chore performing common folk.""

The man shuffled through the lifepaths. ""Goodwife package?""

""Indeed,"" the woman chuckled.

""Dress, bonnet, bustle, apron, baking bread and making stew? No muscles and sword? No founding an empire?"" the man chuckled.

""It has been a long time since I decided that I would roll that way,"" the woman said. She hit accept. ""I'm done, that should help you.""

The man went through the options quickly, Reading the sections, paging back and forth. He saw the option for 'optimization assistant' and closed that out. He chose knowledge, muscle memory, tailored out his appearance and body (moving back to that section of the 'lifepath creator' software choosing to customize his body a bit). He added a few cosmetic changes, mainly some tattoos.

At the end, he hit accept.

The screen wiped away, leaving him reclining and staring at the elven woman.

""Once you awaken, you will have the tutorial option. After that, with the exception of leveling up or other choices, you will be in minimal system interaction mode,"" the elf said.

There was a faint hiss and all four humans closed their eyes, going to sleep.

\-----

False day painted the edge of the world with a cold steely light. It swept over fields waiting to be plowed and planted. Over a hamlet that sat with solid humbleness, surrounding a well and a small town square.

With dawn came life. Horses began to move about, pigs started to squeal, chickens clucked, roosters crowed, cows began to moo. People stirred, babies fussed, and men and women slowly got out of bed, stretching.

Life began to move around in the hamlet.

In one bed a man and woman were curled up together, babies next to the woman, the boy baby holding his sister tightly as she sleepily nursed.

The male rolled over and stared at the ceiling.

\[WOULD YOU LIKE TO EXPERIENCE THE TUTORIAL?\]

appeared in his vision.

He blinked twice.

\-----

The woman was slightly plump, her belly still slightly pudgy from carrying twins. She smiled as she turned from the wood heated stove and shoveled eggs onto the plate in front of the man. Her skin was a rich brown, her hair done up in tight braids that fell down her back. The man had pinkish skin, freckles, and his reddish-brown hair was pulled back in a pony tail and his beard was braided.

""Good morning, husband,"" the woman said. She scooped some eggs onto the tray in front of the girl, then the boy, babies. The girl grabbed a handful and smashed them into her mouth, half of them dropping out of her fist and onto the tray. The boy decided he wanted to smash the scrambled eggs onto the tray with an open hand, smacking the food and laughing at the feeling.

""Good morning, wife,"" the man said.

""Memories unspooling right?"" the woman asked, setting the pan on the stove and turning to sit down next to him, picking up her fork.

""Slowly, but yes,"" he said.

""We got good rolls,"" the woman said. ""A tavern-keeper in a modest settlement, a well kept and well stocked tavern with a kitchen for me to work.""

""I did the tutorial,"" he said. ""Well, there's more for me to do. Learn to pour beer and ale, deal with customers, stuff like that,"" he looked out the window. ""The Born Whole system looks like it is working.""

The woman nodded. ""So far,"" she said.

""I thought we were going to head for the World Engine and Master Control,"" the man said.

The woman laughed, reaching out and hugging him side-armed.

""You do not just run at the epic quests as soon as you log in,"" she laughed. ""No. We'll need allies, need to understand the world's rules.""

The man nodded.

""You need time for your reflexes and memories to unspool and burn in. The children need to get older,"" she said. She looked out the window. ""Right now, just knowing the Born Whole system is working is enough.""

""Is it safe to use metagame terms?"" The man asked.

The woman nodded. ""Until we are out of the tutorial, we are allowed metagame terms,"" she said.

The man took a bite of eggs, chewed, and swallowed. ""What do you suppose this place is called.""

""What all tutorial settlements are called since before before even VR was thing,"" the woman said.

The man took a sip of juice. ""What's that?""

""Pornshire.""

Jak Smithson (Formerly Major James Winnifred Acharya) bounced the girl baby on his knee, letting her chew on a peeled potato while making ferocious little noises. He watched Goody Matilda Smithson (Formerly Mukantagara Elizabeth Carnight) polish the tabletop with a cloth.

The empty tavern practically oozed domesticism.

He set the baby on the floor and poured two ales into heavy ceramic mugs, setting them both down after making sure they both had a thick head of foam.

The baby immediately crawled over and bit her brother's foot, who then kicked her in the face.

Matilda straightened up, put the rag in her pocket, and headed for the bar. She paused for a second to use her toes to push apart the struggling twins, who crawled off in different directions, then walked up and sat down on one of the stools.

""You've gotten better,"" she commented. She lifted up the chilled ale, took a long drink, then wiped her face and smiled. ""You've been using the tutorial.""

""Well, that and serving customers,"" he said. He shook his head. ""You know all about CloneLyfeYo and the Born Whole system in my old line of work, but then you see it applied like this and the sheer power and flexibility of the system suddenly hits home.""

Matilda nodded, setting down the mug. ""All of our neighbors, the farmers, the trader that came by today, all of them did not exist a week ago,"" she made a motion to encompass the well worn and cared for tavern. ""It looks to be a century old, at least, yet we both know there was nothing here but grass and rocks and sunshine a week ago.""

Jak nodded.

""How many Barbary Shop Tokens do you have left?"" Matilda asked.

Jak frowned. ""Uh..."" he lifted on hand and cocked his wrist, then typed quickly on the invisible keyboard. ""Six. I bought the avatar customization pack you told me.""

Matilda nodded. ""Good,"" she tapped the bar. ""Set your left arm down then lean over and kiss me.""

Jak smiled. ""I like that last part.""

They kissed and Matlida kept her mouth next to his ear. ""This might burn, but show no sign, Space Force,"" she said softly.

Her hand caressed his elbow, where a swirling savage tattoo decorated the flesh, even as she kissed him again. Jak felt the burn but ignored it, checking on the twins quickly (both were trying to figure out how to get loose from being stuck under chairs) before shutting his eyes and sinking into the kiss.

When the kiss broke she pulled back and pointed at his arm with one hand, grabbing the chilled mug with the other.

Jak noticed that the frost on the mug dissolved around her hand almost instantly. Heat transfer for some reason.

""Do a GM wakeup request,"" she said. She pointed at his elbow. ""Tell them you have a cosmetic item error for a cash shop purchase.""

The tattoo was smeared and warped.

He nodded, going through the motions to bring up the virtual keyboard and screen. He ignored that Matilda did the same, but very carefully, almost like she was trying to avoid being seen.

""Loading up some quick mods,"" she said softly. ""End user mods are legal on this server, mostly for certain managements, but they only work in limited areas,"" she said.

""Like where?"" Jak asked. He grabbed a pottery jar and fished out two pickled eggs, handing her one.

""Why do you think I wanted to do the tutorial so badly?"" she asked. ""Mods loaded. Now, we wait a minute,"" she said. She went over and picked up the babies, one under each arm, and carried them over to their feeding seats. Both excitedly pounded on the tray in front of them, babbling in baby-speak. She went over and got the potatoes, dusting them off, and spilled a touch of salt on them before handing them back.

Both babies attacked the raw salted potatoes with their gums, making fierce happy noises babies make when they eat. Matilda stood in front of them, making noises back and twiddling her fingers in front of their faces.

Jak almost jumped when a thin, balding male Terran in a robe appeared.

""No live customer service agent is available. I have been assigned to your trouble ticket. You have requested GM service regarding a cash shop cosmetic item purchase?"" it asked.

Jak noted out of the corner of his eye that Matilda had glanced over when he's jumped and was now wiggling her hands in front of both babies' faces while she babbled back at them.

""Yes. My tattoo is smeared,"" he said, pointing at his arm.

The GM looked it over. ""It appears you shifted while having dermal decorations applied during finalization. With your permission, I will repair it,"" it said.

""Please,"" Jak said.

The ink shivered and began to move over. There was a slight tingling feeling as the ink shifted back to how it was supposed to look, then shading, opacity, and color matching was applied.

""Your cash shop item has been repaired. Do you require additional admin services?"" the GM asked.

He glanced at Matilda, who shook her head slightly and stood up straight.

""No, thank you,"" Jak said.

""LyfeTek Industries appreciates your patronage,"" the robed figure said. It then vanished.

""What..."" Jak started to ask.

""It's still going to log for the next few hours. Make sure you aren't running cash shop scams,"" Matilda said. ""Help me with the babies. We'll talk once they're asleep.""

Jak just nodded.

Matilda was the pro-LARPer.

\-----

The night was warm, full of buzzing insects, many of them with twinkling phosphorescent abdomens. The sound of cattle creatures could faintly be heard off in the distance. The stars were bright and shining, the two moons full in the sky.

Jak came out and sat down, handing a bottle of beer to Matilda. Matilda smiled and cracked open the ceramic top of the bottle by pushing on the wire. She took a long drink and looked around for a moment before making a strange motion and cocking her wrist. She typed quickly on the keyboard only she could see and then closed it all.

""Clear?"" Jak asked.

Matilda nodded. ""Clear.""

""I did a Whois earlier,"" Jak said.

""And found just the two of us online across the entire stellar system. Everything else is NPC Born Whole,"" Matilda said. She sighed. ""It has a melancholy feel, does it not? That we are surrounded by life, yet we are the only four who truly lived.""

Jak nodded.

There was silence for a long moment.

""Do you regret it?"" Matilda asked.

""Regret what?"" Jak asked, setting down the beer.

They kissed again for a moment. When Matilda leaned back she waved at him, a lazy gesture that encompassed his whole body.

""The touch of the Digital Omnimessiah after the War In Heaven. That he restored you to flesh. No longer more metal than meat. That you no longer have the cybernetic and bioware that you had spent centuries honing your skills with,"" she said.

Jak leaned back, picking up his beer. He stared at the swirling glowing bugs silently for a long moment, sipping on his beer. Finally he set it down.

""No,"" he said. ""This body is more suited to this place. More suited to being with you. With the Xenocide Event, the universe has changed, and I do not regret being almost full meat.""

Matilda nodded slowly.

""One of the reasons I chose here, why I stayed so long in the humble forest on Telkan, was to give you time to acclimate to your new body,"" she said. She took a sip of beer and stared at the insects. ""Both of us were changed, deeply, by the War In Heaven and the touch of the Digital Omnimessiah. I believe you were more easily able to adapt to the changes.""

Jak frowned. ""Changes?""

Matilda nodded, running a hand over her cloth covered legs. ""I dress modestly and go about life demurely. No longer am I Lady Khoonkeenadee. I knew that the minute I felt his touch upon my brow. While I am still capable of, and are willing to be, the brash and aggressive warlord I spent over a century as, things have indeed changed with the Xenocide Event.""

She was silent for a moment.

""And I had to admit to myself that I had been wrong,"" she stated.

""Wrong?""

""Yes, Space Force. Wrong. As I often teased my beloved little brother, I had believed that the Confederacy's strength had been spent. As I had fallen into believing that I was stronger, I often mocked my little brother, whose strength was utilized to keep safe myself, my children, and everyone I had ever known,"" she said softly. ""I spoke arrogantly to him, and in doing so, I belittled his life choices.""

She was silent again for a long time.

""I mistook restraint for weakness. For horror at just what power they wielded as an unwillingness to bring power to bear,"" she said. She shook her head. ""Through  the eyes of the World Engine, I saw the might of the Confederacy revealed when the Ringbreaker was unleashed. When I saw the bravery and the determination of the newest peoples of the Confederacy.""

She took another sip of beer, still staring at the insects that floated over the grass.

""I had been wrong. I had been arrogant,"" she took another sip. ""And now I am humbled.""

Jak leaned over and hugged her, taking a moment to kiss the side of her head, before keeping her close.

""More than a few times I found myself wondering just what I was fighting to protect. Just what I was putting my life on the line for. It seemed like every time we got a fire put out, some half-wit civilian started another one that threatened to drown the Spur in blood,"" Jak admitted. ""But the Big C3 reminded me of what I was doing. The War In Heaven clinched it.""

Matilda nodded and they sat silently for a moment.

Two of the little insects turned red for a moment, then went back to green.

""There was the speech algorithm checking us,"" she said. She smiled as she took another sip. ""Do you know why I encouraged you to do the tutorial, Space Force?""

""So I could get used to this body some more?"" Jak asked.

She nodded. ""Yes. You are listed as a complete newbie. Which means you have algorithms and VI's watching you in case you need assistance. I am registered as a professional, meaning they don't bother to devote as much VI and algorithm overwatch and investigation to me in the tutorial.""

She made a motion at the mountains barely visible in the distance. More dark patches obscuring stars than actual mountains.

Out there, I will be watched constantly to make sure I don't bend the game too far,"" she said. She smiled. ""Which means that here, in the tutorial area, I can do more.""

""Like what?"" Jak asked.

Matilda rubbed his leg. ""Developers spend the most time crafting the tutorial area. This is where they bring in and hook customers. They use the most amount and most powerful of the dev tools here. Including tools to ensure that they can correct any defects in new players.""

""Like when it fixed my tattoo.""

She nodded. ""Right.""

""And you snatched its access codes,"" Jak guessed.

""Right again. They're only good in the tutorial areas, and probably have alerts if I try to nudge at the cash shop,"" she said. She smiled again. ""That's not what I'm going to use them for.""

""What's your plan?"" Jak asked.

Matilda made a motion. ""The tutorial area would normally be expanding rapidly as people took adventuring classes or archetypes, or began to journey around. The VI generated settlements would quickly expand. A kingdom would have already been put in place by the programmers, but the kingdoms and empires are all dead and have been for over five years.""

""Right. You explained that,"" Jak said.

""I'm going to force the system to run a kingdom generation skript. Force it to create the nation, populate it with Born Whole, then put it on dynamic progression,"" she said. ""There's no way I can get close to the World Engine or those systems, nor will I be able to get close to the Born Whole systems, but what I *can* do is push a dev-skript I've got in some of my wetware.""

""Why do you even *have* that stuff? Where did you get it?"" Jak asked.

""All pros keep wetware storage. Mostly for custom templates for your nanite creation organ. Custom skripts you figured out to generate 'spell' effects, or linguistic skripts, stuff like that,"" she said. ""I always keep a few dev-skript samples so I can compare them.""

Her smile got wider. ""There's only a few programmers that could work on world generation software, and over the decades I got familiar with their work,"" she made a vague motion at the air. ""I recognize this programmer's style and approaches. He's pretty famous in our circles. Reclusive, almost nothing about him beyond his code, his name, and who he works for.""

""Anyone I'd know?"" Jak smiled.

""Doubtful. He works, or rather, worked for an Omnicorp before the TXE. He did a lot of work on Born Whole systems and neural templates as well as LARP SUDS rebirth systems,"" Matilda said. She smiled. ""He does great work, but he's got a tendency to repeat himself with his coding. I know for a fact he uses several variable names repeatedly for set things, as well as a few of us have hacked out his backdoor passwords.""

""Huh, sounds like an egghead,"" Jak said.

Matilda laughed.

""With all the extensive error catching software, the generation software, and all the other dev-tools that are accessible from the tutorial area, I figure I can push the kingdom generation skript with the variables I set,"" she said. ""I figure fifteen million sentients across the nine races. Six large cities, a pair of seaports, strong military, and good trade, with the surrounding areas being territory of large city states with populations of a couple millions, I should get what I'm after.""

Jak frowned. ""What's that?""

""Stable breeding pool of only marginally altered humans,"" she said. ""One thing about that programmer, he always has error catching and garbage collection happen at roughly the same triggers. I activate those triggers, it'll run the error catching and garbage collection, and I'll be able to access the dev tools.""

""Sounds complicated,"" Jak grinned. ""Mind if I just sit here and drink beer?""

""As long as you have some for me,"" she said. She gave him a sideways look. ""The children are over a year old, we are safe and secure here for as long as we remain spec'd as commoners. My belly is ripening and I want something from you.""

Jak grinned. ""I think I can handle that part.""

Her smile grew mischievous. ""You have so far.""

""Hey, do you know that programmer's name?"" Jak asked.

Matilda nodded. ""Indeed I do. Back when we were trying to social media scrape him only to discover he has no social media presence.""

""What is it?"" Jak asked.

Matilda shrugged. ""Executive Programmer Darsh Chasu Igwe. He works for Nexus-Sigma Omnicorp, which LyfeTek Industries is a subsidiary of. A genius.""

2023-03-06,1678119665,"Free ticket to Peru, Conclusion! So I went to Peru for 23 days with a random r/gaybros user!!","Hi! It's me again.

Two months ago I posted here mentioning that I was going on a trip to Peru that I had partially already paid for as a gift to my husband. However he thought having an affair with one of my best friends and then being emotionally abusive for months sounded much more fun. (Also yeah keep threatening me with NDA's and whatever else you want. *I personally* am not afraid of the truth, but clearly you and yours are. Maybe someone should write a book?)

Anyways now with that housekeeping out of the way we can get to the main event! ""How exactly did your trip with a random [r/gaybros](http://r/gaybros) user go?""

The short version? One of the greatest experiences of my life.

Now buckle up for the long version because here she comes!

The flight despite being Spirit was actually amazing in large part due to the crew being so wonderful. They even gave us a small gift from all of them at the end. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better start.

&amp;#x200B;

[Our first photo in Peru isn't he handsome even after 12 hours of travel?](https://preview.redd.it/2ec6bpem55ma1.jpg?width=1204&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c657f91a4732e48d4ab511dd27bc9db88697a230)

We touched down and things immediately started to go wrong, (don't they always?). I was under the impression that a major international airport would have someone selling sim cards to travelers because, well, that's like standard procedure. That was not the case here and so we were already without internet access for things like uber. (It's just so much easier to use Uber or its equivalent rather than argue with taxis). After making sure the Airbnb definitely had wifi we secured a taxi and I got to watch G marvel at the driving situation. It was his first time in a country where driving is treated like live action Mario Kart, where rules are suggestions and just about anything goes. As a bus came within inches of crushing us he laughed and I was just so happy to get to share a first experience like this with someone.

We got to the Airbnb and finally had our first kiss-- he had refused to do so in the airport or airplane as, ""That's not romantic."" A sentiment to which I eyerolled. Now I know what the next question is, ""Sex?"". All I'll say on the subject is that we are two 27 year olds on a romantic adventure so duh it happened, and yes it was amazing. In fact it reminded me of a passage from Jennette McCurdy's book, ""I'm glad my Mom Died"" in which she has great sex for the first time and cries because she didn't know it could be that great. The sentiment of that passage hit me like bricks when I realized that I too maybe hadn't known what it was like to have an emotional connection with someone you think is hot as breakfast and how the act is wholly elevated to something of a religious experience when all the pieces are present like this.

G couldn't stop filming and chasing and petting all the cats in Lima as we walked to eat which was just fucking adorable. After breakfast we headed to the main square in order to secure some tours. (I highly recommend not booking out of the country because the prices you see will always be much much higher than negotiating in person). I kept collecting pamphlets from the various people selling tours and holding them out. Chumming the waters and attempting to flush out the correct person. G to his credit played ball with the lengthy process despite his obvious confusion as to what exactly I was trying to achieve with a dozen pamphlets and a refusal to actually talk to anyone.

And then finally Willman appeared.

""55$ day trip to Paracas"" He said immediately to me without bothering to hand me a pamphlet. This price was significantly cheaper than the $70-$100 on the pamphlets. This man knew what I wanted, he knew it wasn't my first go at this, and so I agreed to follow him. G looked mildly concerned with just how far we were following this man to the tourist office, but once we sat down and started on the details he quickly became excited. $55 for an Island Tour, transportation, pisco, and four wheeling sounded amazing and so we signed on.

Willman then took us around Lima for free-- I knew he was probably getting kickbacks but I didn't mind as long as the prices all remained fair. We saw catacombs and churches and drank too much Pisco. At one point I gave him two mini bottles of jack daniels and somehow we all were drunk by the end of it all.

G ended up pointing at a mountain and-- well my memory is fuzzy, because, well we were drunk lol, but it was something like, ""That's pretty"" or ""can we go up there?

Willman quickly called his friend with a ""motocar"" (essentially a tuk-tuk), and we started driving up the mountain. It was good we were drunk or I might have been more nervous to realize we were entering the Peruvian version of a Favela, one of the ""Pueblos jóvenes"".

The tuk-tuk blew a tire and we were stranded halfway up while they fixed it. I proceeded to hand out candy to the little children that quickly gathered around us and Willman ran off to buy us more beer. G laughed at the absurdity of me doing the very thing you're told not to do as a child. I was literally a stranger handing candy to children. He was just so full of life. I had forgotten what it was like to spend time with someone who was simply happy to be there someone who didnt see problems as personal affronts to themselves. It filled me with a particular kind of starry joy, one that lit me from within. I felt like one of the children who had just gotten a handful of candy.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Pueblos jóvenes had their own kind of beauty \(waiting for the tire to be fixed\)](https://preview.redd.it/kwp6o0hv55ma1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0ca0b3bad9fac6e952816be4e26be5e9f7d8d699)

Eventually the tire was fixed and Willman returned with beers and we continued chugging up the mountain.

&amp;#x200B;

[The view was worth it](https://preview.redd.it/um9ush6065ma1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b35bd7f27b892e56270147f930947498d744470b)

And so yeah, I'd say day one was extremely successful.

The next couple of days were just us slowly touring Lima. I don't know if it was us or what but Peruvian food just was not doing it for us. Plainer than Mexican, (as a Mexican I adore my food), less rich than American, and cooked more in the French tradition of good ingredients not heavily spiced, it just wasn't our favorite. This was disappointing because food is so important to me, and it was an initial thing I connected to G on. A mutual adoration of food as a centerpoint in our lives. The museums however did live up to the hype. The Larco and the textile museums both were particular standouts.

&amp;#x200B;

[Lima was a gorgeous city](https://preview.redd.it/dauukhna65ma1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=23699da2c64eb9edd24b725419a8fde16a0a4614)

[We both loved that it was covered in murals](https://preview.redd.it/8l2l4b8965ma1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20a5167bbb7b86d6dbe11f60ce1b3ab0d8153fdf)

And the people of Lima were amazing too. At one point while switching airbnb's we were given an address that didn't exist. At 11:30 at night we were stranded with all our luggage on the side of the road. Beginning to panic, I started stopping random residents and asking for help in my terrible spanish. Eventually this married couple stopped and then proceeded to spend an hour attempting to find this address even going so far as to stop other people and a police officer. Eventually with a small but growing collection of Lima residents we realized the address just couldn't have been real. So the couple went and *got their car and drove us around.* I am still stunned by this kindness. I mean they truly went above and beyond what was necessary. Its times like this that restore your faith in humanity. I mean clearly we aren't all bad. They called hotels and eventually found us one that was open and wouldn't break our bank-- The Hotel Santa Cruz.

God we hated that hotel.

Rust came from the faucet at times, it had a mildewy air to it, we were given a twin bed to share and they might as well use literal sandpaper for the sheets.

And yet we both 100% would stay again and highly recommend it.

&amp;#x200B;

[Checking into Santa Cruz while G carries 90&amp;#37; of the bags because he was unbelievably amazing](https://preview.redd.it/cs8sn6re65ma1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1fb44f7c615800284a41212a785d9cab11b484e7)

It was less than 40$ a night and the staff were awesome. They accommodated requests, they were open 24/7. They were always so sweet and I just, honestly Peru really is the people. Some populations detract from your experience. I have been shoved in China, I have been hounded for tips in Egypt, I have experienced the ""ask for help in English"" no response ""start asking for help in bad French"" and get told in perfect English ""UGH OKAY, what do you want"" in France. Peruvians were just nice. It was so refreshing to just be in a country of nice people. I had forgotten what that was like especially with how shitty and scarring my divorce in 2022 had been.

Finally the day trip to Paracas came! There were two British girls on the trip and I immediately decided we were going to be friends. We toured the Ballestas Islands by boat and they were amazing. Guys, we literally saw a sea lion swim up to a bird and eat it. Like literally there was a bird there, then a second later that bird was snatched, shook, and pulled underwater. Real life NatGeo moment. While walking cliffs on a separate beach, a huge bug started flying around me and I reacted exactly like you'd think. I flailed my arms and squeaked, ""G kill it"" while he laughed. The British girls- Tal and Pippa, also laughed at the display. Seeing my chance I started talking to them and the four of us became a group for the rest of the tour. I gave everyone a shot of titos and while opening them our tour guide, Jenny, came up and I gave her one too. She proudly pointed out that the drink of choice in Peru-- Pisco, was much stronger and then threw it back like a champ. We had another mediocre lunch elevated by good company, though Tal was the real saving grace. A bike lover like G, she extolled the virtues of adventure to him. For the first time in the trip I was filled with that particular kind of hope, the hazy kind. The most dangerous kind. The kind of hope that picks you up and just as quickly lets you fall headfirst into the earth. But watching Tal make the same arguments I had been making for weeks I couldnt help but be buoyed by this treacherous feeling.

Afterwards we went to a Pisco tasting. Feeling bold I grabbed two tasting cups, Tal saw this and grabbed two as well. Everytime Jenny came around I would hold both out, she would laugh and fill them both as I said ""Gracias mama, lo quiero muchio"". Tal's inner brit got the best of her the first few rounds but soon she two was getting two cups filled. There four of us definitely got a little tipsy-- but not too much.

Afterwards while waiting for Pippa and G to use the restroom, Jenny came up to Tal and I and asked me to buy a bottle. We both said no-- G and I already had enough alcohol at the hotel and Tal was backpacking. She came up twice more and twice more we said no. Suddenly she approached again with a bottle. ""oh no"" I whispered to Tal who nodded, both of us thinking the same thing, 'here comes the high pressure sale. Instead Jenny said ""Here, it's a gift"" and handed a speechless me a full bottle of nice Pisco.

Later when we had regrouped Tal asked, Grey, how exactly did you swing that?? while pointing at the bottle.

G frowned and added, yeah did you buy that? Where did this come from?

Pippa, no she just gave it to him

Tal, No, She asked him to buy something AND HE SAID NO, AND SHE CAME BACK AND GAVE HIM A FREE BOTTLE ANYWAYS

Pippa, absolutely mad

I totally understand why a Taylor Swift lyric is, ""God I love the English"", because I still belly laugh to their inflections and expressions during this short conversation.

We ended up going to dinner and drinks with them that night. I really loved our day with them. So much of traveling is defined by the people you meet and our interactions with them are something I'll remember for decades to come.

The next day, (our last in Lima) was mostly spent in the hotel. The food had finally caught up to my poor grumpy giant and his intestinal distress had transformed into chills and a slight fever. I feel really lucky to have gone with someone like G. So many people would have turned into little children at this moment but he powered on. I found him medication and rubbed his back and he slowly felt better. It's just a reality of traveling to a country like Peru, especially as it was his first time dealing with this specific issue, (he's also been to Scotland but intestinal distress isn't on the menu in western Europe). I know it sounds silly but I cherish this memory. The room stank like hell from the gastrointestinal issues, G could barely function, and I was freaking out and panicking over our inability to purchase tickets with LatAm.

But god was it magic.

How many times do you get to experience, and help with, someones first illness in a truly exotic country? How many times do you get to lay in bed and help someone feel better someone who is truly grateful for it? How many times are you stuck in a shitty hotel without any way forward and *suddenly*, all at once, just about every issue gets resolved? How many times do you get to cuddle with a truly handsome, sweet, and all together great guy?

The next day we flew to Iquitos--we didn't get to sit next to each other and that was honestly the worst thing Peru had done to us at that point, and I got in touch with my contact from the Dallas World Aquarium, (The DWA funds a rescue center for critically endangered manatees in Iquitos)

Guys Manatees are just living squishmellows and I have no idea why anyone would harm something so precious. If anyone is also interested in donating to the center I can give you the contact info.

After that started the most significant portion of our trip. We were picked up by our guide Jr and taken far out of the city to a boat on the Amazon River. And on that boat we met our favorite people in all of Peru-- Angel and Maryory.

&amp;#x200B;

[Maryory, Me, Jr, G, Angel](https://preview.redd.it/eogwnipc75ma1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5df2cd929231a10e8ea79ded36031b2aff1e656a)

I turned to Maryory and asked, ""So the Shakira song"" in Spanish. Her eyes immediately lit up, ""It's furious!"" She said. G and Angel groaned to each other as we launched into a long discussion of Shakira's song and breakup (which I highly related to), Miley Cyrus and Flowers, and more pop music. By the end of the two hour boat ride Jr had decided to just treat us as a group of four rather than two separate couples. I offered them mini shots but Maryory refused because she was doing Ayuasca that night. I looked at G, ""Are you interested?"" He nodded yes.

After landing at the jungle hotel, we met the shaman, and damn was she a shaman. Exactly what you're thinking of when you hear the word Shaman. We chatted, figured out the price, and decided to go for it. I remember G stating, ""We're insane"" a bunch. I pointed out that this wasn't any more insane than going to a random country with a random guy off reddit. Still anxiety hit us both in waves.

Our room had no real walls, just screens with curtains. This made G really uncomfortable because it meant silhouettes would be visible.

After settling in we went to monkey island where the monkeys proceeded to treat us like jungle gyms. Two little ones fought each other while grappling around G. I have a long and hilarious video of his unsuccessful attempts to get them to stop fighting each other

&amp;#x200B;

[Afterwards we were not allowed to eat because of the Ayuasca. I was particularly saddened by this. ](https://preview.redd.it/yfc6qgwn75ma1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=97b2cbd772936d74602e49671d975f086f89852d)

Finally the time for Ayuasca came. There were 5 of us in a room. They explained the process and then started filling a cup with the brown liquid. It was disgusting. G took his so well the Shaman commented that he drank it ""like chocolate"". I can't hide my facial expressions like him so every atom of disgust was etched in mine. Before too long the generator turned off for the night and we were left in pitch black darkness with only the Shaman's pinpricks of Tabaco embers as light.

The Ayuasca hit me faster and harder than the others, apparently within ten minutes. I started to throw up. Over and over again I threw up. My whole body felt like it was being ripped apart. I felt like I was on fire. In the dark I grasped for G's hand. I demanded Jr make the Ayuasca stop. Jr forlornly informed me he couldn't. I kept throwing up-- for hours. And I babbled louder and louder. At one point Angel got up and hugged me. I really appreciated that. G was extremely worried and doing what he could to help me as I sobbed and vomited and screamed and babbled. ""I AM SO UNCOMFORTABLE"" I shouted.

""You love this"" the demon in my throwup bucket responded

I stared at it and then vomited again

""You love this. You love being uncomfortable and unhappy""

More retching from me. I was now completely empty of even bile.

The demon laughed ""Your normal is throwing up. You love this""

I cried. It was true. This was my life. I had lived so sad and uncomfortable for so long I didn't know what happy was. I couldn't be alone in my head because it was so spiky and sad in there. I never dealt with the death of my aunt a week after my husband's infidelity with my best friend was revealed. I never dealt with what my friend had actually done to me, nor with how traumatic their decision to just keep going on as normal and remove me for ""not getting over it and being dramatic"" was. How evil and despicable it was that I had pleaded for just a two week break through the beginning of October, just so I could process and then we could all talk. How the affair continued behind my back. How I was slowly lifted out in favor of this new dynamic where my husband was replacing me with my friend in a social setting. How my husband and his business partners conspired together to have been banned from the bars they owned and safe places I once had. How my life was slowly reduced to just my apartment as depression started cutting deep. How I would have probably died there if three people hadn't panicked and started the arduous process of helping me help myself. I hadn't dealt with this yet and I was now being forced to confront it. Even more it made me look at my life and all the anger I had dissolved. The Ayuasca left me without anger but full of pity. I felt sad for my husband and friend. I had been so miserable in that life and now I had a way out but they didn't. I had once tried to tell my friend that his partner of ten years constantly cheated on him, he got angry and asked me why I was trying to ruin his relationship. My husband is a deeply lonely person who distracts himself by partying. His business partner once admitted how lonely he was to me, and when I asked if that was hard he said something like, ""No if it bothers me too much I just work harder and forget"". I felt awful for this group of people who were deeply unhappy but who lacked the tools to find anything other than a distraction. And that's just three examples, I knew dozens of people like this. The Ayuasca was forcing me to confront the fact that my life had been empty and hollow and pointless. And I was crying because there were people that I loved despite everything who were still trapped in that.

It was a lot to confront all of that. To feel months and years of hurt and anger and fury and pain. To really live my trauma and talk to it.

The demon went away and I stopped throwing up.

G squeezed my hand and I felt an overwhelming amount of love for him as a human. I was so lucky this man was here. I was so fortunate that someone like this was comforting me. It felt like proof of god almost that someone this handsome and smart and athletic (he routinely bikes over a hundred miles in a day y'all) and funny and just absolutely awe inspiringly loveable had come with me. I could not believe I had the privilege of holding his hand or occupying any part of his mind. I felt so grateful for his concern.  I saw us get married and move to Seattle and have children and die surrounded by grandchildren. I saw us move to Seattle and become best friends who were in each other's weddings and supported each other through life's ups and downs. I saw that love takes many forms, romantic or otherwise and that love in of itself is enough

""I love you"" I shouted, feeling everything crescendo. Then I took my shirt off and laid on the ground. Thank god it was dark so I didn't have to confront my body issues as well.

That's how I spent the last hours on Ayuasca, feeling feelings and laying on the ground, then sitting up and holding G's hand. On repeat like clockwork.

Finally we all started coming out of it. G looked weird, ""what's wrong""

""I didn't feel anything,"" he told me.

I was shocked. Apparently it hadn't really hit him. I insisted on being walked back to our room. I was tired of our environment and he was too. G tried to use the restroom and started throwing up. I couldn't get off the bed. He managed his way back fully in the throes of his trip now. He was overheating and uncomfortable. I managed to cool him down. We held hands for hours while he had his own trip.

The next day while laying in a hammock he said I love you too. Not in a romantic way, but in the way I had felt. Just in a pure, ethereal, beautiful way. When you love someone for the human they are and not because you need anything else from them.

The rest of the Amazon trip was amazing. We fished for piranha using fishing line tied to sticks. We swam in the amazon with dolphins in view. We ate our meals with A &amp; M and bonded with them more. We went on a nightwalk and ziplined and swang and climbed over a hundred feet in the air. G caught and got rid of a giant flying roach for me-- and then was shocked when I happily held and caressed a tarantula. But Tarantula's are hardly bugs, they're cute and fuzzy and I had one as a child who would sit on my head while I watched cartoons. The Iquitos leg of the trip was so amazing I fail to capture just how life changing and awe inspiring it was.

Maryory and Angel invited us to visit them so we said we'd try. And when we got back to Lima I was confronted with a dilemma. Cusco and Arequipa were still dangerous according to literally every Peruvian I asked. One literally told me ""don't be stupid"" when I asked if we should go. We suddenly had time on our hands so I texted M&amp;A. ""Come Friday and you can sleepover!"" was the answer.

We spent the rest of the day doing nothing. I cooked, we drank beer, acted romantic and watched most of the first season of Spongebob. It was perfect. I look back to this day of Spongbob and bliss often, and I wish I could have had 100 more of them.

On Friday we got a taxi to Lurin to visit A&amp;M. As soon as the car got to the main plaza they appeared happily waving at us. We walked to Maryory's family's place of work to store our bigger bags (namely just bertha). It was fun walking down the street of a city that never saw tourism with all this luggage and tall sticks-out-like-a-sore-thumb G. Maryory flagged a tuk-tuk down and took us to her home with her crazy dog named Peggy.

We helped set up for Maryory's birthday party and gather supplies. Her birthday was great and their family was amazing. Her mother's food made me see the light on Peruvian cooking. It was fucking delicious. G and I were floored by how wonderful it tasted and couldn't get enough. The family danced and sang and drank. Her mom was amazing, she even helped me out-- I had a rock lodged in my foot from surfing the day before and she quickly got to work pulling it out and fixing my foot.

This night was further proof of how wonderful humanity can be. We adored their family and I will forever be grateful we had the privilege of not only meeting them but getting to experience their love and warmth in their own home.

After this we went on the last leg of our trip! Huaraz. This city was our favorite of the tourist things we did. We climbed mountains, saw ruins and overall it was 10/10. G made me do a 6 hour roundtrip hike and I loved it! It was hilarious because him and I and a German couple we befriended finished the hike first despite the rest of the group being Peruvian. We were certain that we'd be near the end because we really could not breathe at all. The tours were cheap and they went all day, after 4 days of nonstop action we finally made our way back to lima for the last two days

I had booked a reservation at Central forever ago. It's supposed to be one of the greatest restaurants in the world. It definitely lived up to its reputation. While getting ready for the reservation we got distracted... and by the time we were trying to pull our clothes out of the drier we were already running late. Did you know that Peruvian driers lock? Cause I didn't. I frantically called the host, she couldn't help us. ""G pull it out and unplug the evil thing!"" I yelled. G had me sit down. Eventually we had to give up on the clothes in the dryer. We put on wrinkled shirts and shorts. G was 11/10 grumpy, I was no less snippy. We RAN like hell to the uber and I texted Central begging them to hold the reservation. How was I to know Peruvian driers locked!

At the restaurant G felt very self conscious, it was his first time at place like this and we rolled in like a hot mess. I stroked his arm, ""It's okay babe just relax. Hot messes tend to belong anyways. It's the people who aren't concerned with fitting in and roll in hair blown and boots muddy that tend to be the wealthiest anyways. So just breathe into it.""

The food was amazing. I cannot overstate how it was one of the greatest meals I have ever had in my life.

After 12 courses and a ton of alcohol we drunkenly made our way back to the apartment to sleep. We went out but the bar wasn't our scene so we didn't stay too long. The next day we traveled back to Lurin to pick up our bags from Maryory and Angel. It was really nice spending one more day with them. We then proceeded to miss our flight and ended right back at the Hotel Santa Cruz.

The last ahem, bonus, day was amazing. The morning was great, then we rented bikes and G made me bike up a mountain. Afterwards we did not miss our flight but G missed his connection. That was the universe being kind to me because I had a 12 hour layover.

We spent the day in the airport hanging out. I would have stayed in that airport forever.

And now? Two days later I'm back home in ugly reality. My laptop charger broke and when I asked my husband for the 100$ he owed me he claimed he didn't have it. Not even the 20$ for a new charger... I also am back at the bleak reality of trying to find a job while sharing an apartment with a man who really harmed me. Hopefully the job comes quickly.

And G? Well I wish we had something satisfactory to say, but unless moving money drops out of the sky suddenly then we have no update. He lives a thousand miles away and emptied his savings for this. If I hadn't pre-paid I would have never been able to do this jobless and in an acrimonious divorce. That's the part that rom-coms don't show. The part where financial reality keeps two people apart. Not to mention the fact that we've only known each other for two months. Maybe we'll save money and move to Seattle together. Maybe he'll miss me enough to want to try dating. Maybe I'll take the Peace Corps job and scuttle any chance at a future. Maybe we'll be friends. Maybe we won't keep in touch. Life is long and unpredictable.

But I will always love G for these three weeks. They were perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.

The pharmaceutical industry wants people to forget what was once common knowledge.","The industry wants people to think we *need* injections to remain healthy.  The industry's most successful business model is to convince people that their natural immunity is insufficient.

Our immune systems can be greatly strengthened with wise dietary and lifestyle choices, but the industry wants you to forget that and pay for ""treatments"" instead. 

This article from 2011 talks about natural immunity and how ***about half of us develop immunity to viruses we are exposed to without ever becoming ""infected"" or ""sick""***. 

&gt;Why do some people end up in bed feverish, hacking and sneezing for days from the flu  when others seem to never get sick?

&gt;To answer that question, University of Michigan researchers did the first study of its kind: They infected 17 healthy people with the flu virus and discovered that **everyone who is exposed to the flu actually is affected by it, but their bodies just have a different way of reacting to it**. Half of the study participants got sick; the other half didnt notice a thing.


&gt;Many people might conclude that if you are exposed to a virus and you dont get sick, its because the virus didnt stick or it was so weak, it just passed right through your system and your system didnt notice. Thats not a correct notion, says Alfred Hero, professor at the University of Michigan College of Engineering and author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal PLoS Genetics.
He continues, **There is an active immune response which accounts for the resistance of certain people getting sick, and that response is just as active as the response we all know and hate, which is being sick with the sniffles, fever, coughing and sneezing. Its just that the responses are different.**

&gt;Hero, along with scientists from Duke University Medical Center and the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences &amp; Policy, studied participants gene expression to watch how the immune system reacted to the flu virus. The analysis reviewed 22,000 genes and 267 blood samples, and used a pattern recognition algorithm and several other methods to discover the genomic signatures associated with the immune response in people who get flu symptoms and those who do not. 

&gt;They found significant and complex immune responses in the people who got sick ***and the people who didnt***. Scientists noticed changes in their blood 36 hours before some people actually felt sick. Although they understand that some peoples immune systems resist the virus, they still dont know how or why that happens.

&gt;There is a behind the scene active immune response even when you dont get sick, Hero says. What we found were differences in their biological metabolism and gene expression. These differences had to do with antioxidants.

As a real bad software developer, I wanted to tell my story so you can learn from it:

I was always good at standardized exams that I studied for. The first time I took the SAT college entrance exam in the US, I scored a perfect 800 on the math and a 720 on the critical reading, for an SAT score of 1520 out of 1600 - a Harvard admissions level SAT score (note I think my writing was 660, which is good but not great, but colleges didn't look at the writing score as much and the essay section isn't even on the SAT anymore). Anyway, I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science from the best public university in my state and was able to pass the coding interviews after studying the book ""Cracking The Coding Interview"" and practicing LeetCode problems, but despite having done well at interviews, I was always a worthless programmer. My first real job in 2016 was an entry level software engineering position at Amazon on the East coast of the US, and despite it being entry/junior level, I started out with a 130k base, 20k bonus issued in monthly installments, and some vesting stock (I had multiple competing offers and negotiated up).

During my two years at Amazon, almost every task followed the same pattern. I would let my manager or senior engineer pick out an ""easy"" task for me in the queue. I would ask my senior engineer where in the codebase the change needed to be made (because I could never learn my way around a codebase I didn't write). I used ""git blame"" to find who wrote or worked on that code before me (all code at Amazon was code reviewed and the name of the Jira issue was in the git commit so if I couldn't ask the person who wrote the code I could ask the person who reviewed it) and I would go to their desk or message them asking them questions about the code because I could not learn a codebase or read code written by other people for the life of me (I was also unable to read long SQL statements with multiple different joins in it and had other particular cognitive troubles). Then I would put print statements in between every single line of code (because I couldn't figure out how to hook up the debugger to the running Java server) and I would run the code over and over, asking my senior engineer for help when I got stuck or didn't know what to do, which was frequent. I would try to ask questions of people other than that senior engineer guy so that all the questions weren't focused on just one person, and I would sort of do a rotation of people to spread out the load of helping me. I had a good relationship with my whole team - we all played board games together every day during lunch so they were generally helpful. Eventually I managed to finish the task, but in the process I took up so much of other, more experienced people's time that they could have just completed my task in about the time I spent receiving help.

I never became able to complete any work independently (even with the regular use of StackOverflow and Google). I never even was able to contribute to any open source project that I wasn't the sole author of despite having tried to get into various different open source projects multiple times. Despite that, I failed up, going from a job at Amazon that paid me $150,000 to another job that paid $86 an hour on W2 in a small city where my rent was $1,350 a month walking distance from work. I did not complete a single task in my three months of time there before I was fired for schizoaffective/bipolar manic psychosis. I tried one more tech work attempt but had the same problems as I did at Amazon (this codebase was in Scala, a programming language I like more than Java, which was used at Amazon, but the Scala code was even harder for me to read than the Java code so I didn't do any better) and my mental health had issues so I basically gave up on programming work entirely. After that I tried to get minimum wage work in places like food service but they didn't want to hire me with my history, and also I eventually developed some neurological symptoms that made very basic things like walking very hard for me and sometimes impossible.

Eventually (like at the age of 25, after less than 3 years of work) I ended up receiving government disability benefits due to psychiatric/neurological brain issues. I now live with my parents (who charge me about $150 a month in rent for the bedroom I grew up in) and collect $2950 a month in SSDI from the government, which I intend to keep doing for the rest of my life (assuming I don't get kicked off benefits during a Continuing Disability Review which the government is supposed to conduct regularly).

Perhaps the brain issues contributed to me being a sucky programming employee. Despite my cognitive issues (I have very specific cognitive issues like being unable to navigate at all without Google Maps), I did well on the coding tests and could write an impressive sounding resume and exaggerate/lie my way through behavioral questions, which is what I was judged on.

2023-02-21,1676995973,"A wedding and a funeral with my SIL, the narcissist","This is long, but its a story I was thinking of the other day. My husband (""Joe"") has a younger sister ""Ann,"" who got married a few years ago. They have long had a tenuous relationship; Ann has narcissistic personality disorder and substance abuse problems. She is prone to violent outbursts of anger, and is obsessed with preserving her perfect image to the outside world. She will only keep friends around who are pure sycophants who never question her; I don't know how she finds these people, but it's disturbing. 

Joe has always been the quiet sibling and the scapegoat of the family, despite being the stable personality. Ann is the princess who can do no wrong in the eyes of their parents, and they were raised dramatically inequitably. (For example, Joe had to earn his spending money with a part-time job. Ann was simply handed money by their parents and was told that she was ""too pretty"" to work. Really.) Ann and my MIL have always painted Joe as the villain in every situation. There are many periods of time where Joe and Ann weren't on speaking terms.

Because Ann is Ann, everything had to be perfect on her special day, including having my husband in her wedding party to project that her family is perfect to everyone invited. To my surprise, she invited me to also be a bridesmaid, even though we didn't have much of a relationship. I wanted to decline, but Joe feared that Ann would react poorly and he told me to just go along with it.

At the time, Joe and I were also in the process of buying our first home together and money was tight. Ann and her fiancée (""Chad"") live in a city which is a two-hour plane ride away. Because of money concerns, we did not make the multiple trips back for the bridal shower or bachelor/bachelorette weekend. My in-laws and Ann all claimed to be understanding of this, and we were relieved.

We flew in for the wedding itself, and things still seemed to be smooth sailing at first. Unfortunately, while Joe and I were relaxing in the hotel before the rehearsal dinner, my mother called me on the phone to deliver the news that my grandmother had passed away. I was extremely close with my grandmother, and I'd even taken a semester off from university to travel with her in her home country. My family is a ~4 hour train ride from where the wedding was happening. It became clear that the funeral would be a few days after the wedding, so I booked the only train I could to get to be there. It left 7:00am the day after the wedding. 

I had trouble keeping my emotions together at the rehearsal dinner. I'd told Ann and my MIL what had happened, and everyone seemed to be understanding. It was an emotionally trying time for me. It was clear the stress of the weekend was also getting to Ann; when she gathered everyone to thank them for coming, she took the opportunity to publicly, drunkenly berate her betrothed, Chad, for losing a box of decorations. (They were in the trunk of her car the whole time.) It was really embarrassing to witness her publicly humiliating the groom, but this is fairly typical behavior for Ann, so no one seemed too concerned.

The wedding prep, photography, and ceremony the next day all went off unremarkably. Somehow, I kept it together, and managed not to cry at inopportune times; but to say the whole day was still emotionally taxing is an understatement. I was dealing with grief and all the stress being in a wedding party entails from early morning to late evening. Ann was drinking from morning to night and took some Xanax from another bridesmaid (""Lisa"") to ""deal with the stress."" 

As the reception was winding down, I asked Joe to leave with me, and he agreed. It was getting late, and I had to undress, pack, and try to catch some sleep before my train ride to the funeral several states away. We went to Ann to give our regrets, and as I was telling her she looked beautiful and we had a great time, her face began to darken. She interrupted me, ""You're not LEAVING already, are you?"" Many guests had already left, and it was late in the evening. Im pretty sure the open bar was in the process of shutting down.
""Yes, I have to get a train to my mom's house for the funeral, remember?""
""There is an AFTER PARTY.""
""Yes, Ann, and I am attending a funeral in two days' time.""
This is when Ann exploded with the narcissistic rage she's known for. Joe and I were treated to a screaming, crying rant about how we were ""uncaring,"" ""didn't even attend the shower or bachelorette,"" how we were ""cheap"", and all manner of other insults. This was in front of everyone on the dance floor. Chad was nowhere to be found (likely drinking in a back room somewhere). It was a shocking barrage of abuse, and that is when I couldn't handle it anymore, and started bawling in front of everyone.

Joe and I simply made our exit. My MIL and FIL caught us on the way out, and we explained what happened. They claimed to be understanding, but we left in a hurry. Meanwhile, some of the sycophants in the wedding party were rushing to Anns side, while she was screaming and crying. By the time we got to the hotel, both Joe and I both had minutes-long voicemails from Ann, airing every insult she could come up with at us; Joe was treated to a rendition of every perceived wrong from their childhood through adulthood, and accused of ruining the wedding. Mine was more of the same; I was accused of not having ""enough fun"" and being ""cheap"" for not being ""all in"" on every single wedding-related event -- a complete 180 from her being understanding that we were also in the process of buying a home. The abuse she hurled at us was astounding, and at that time I simply blocked her on every social media channel I had, Joe blocked her phone number, and forwarded his voice mail to both of his parents, saying ""Look at this piece of s--t you raised! How dare she treat my wife that way!""

The next morning as I was waiting for the train, the scapegoating began. My  MIL texted me and told me that Ann and I both needed to ""get over it"" and that Joe owed Ann an apology. Ann texted me and said that she was sorry for being ""drunk and on Lisa's Xanax"" but that I just didn't understand her lifelong dynamic with Joe. The blame was fully on Joe, not me; it's as if every person in this situation forgot it was ME who wanted to leave, not Joe. Chad, however, waited until he knew I was sitting in the funeral to berate me for ruining his wedding and hurl his own insults.

We didn't speak to Joe's parents for almost six months because they both thought that we owed the apology to Ann, not the other way around. Ann has told a bunch of lies to anyone who will listen about how Joe ruined her wedding, and the grossest part is that, despite witnessing it, my in-laws still agree with her because they're scared of her fierce, alcohol-induced rage. My MIL still brings up the fact that we returned Ann's wedding gift and kept the money, calling us ""petty"" and ""cheap."" 

I hate weddings.

Edit: I think it bears clarifying that we havent spoken to Ann or Chad since this happened. I personally will not speak to or visit my in-laws.","weddingshaming",77,"https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingshaming/comments/1187wu9/a_wedding_and_a_funeral_with_my_sil_the_narcissist/"
2023-02-05,1675604274,"Strand Unraveled: The Unification of String Theory &amp; Panpsychism","*So in this post I want to take the time to analyze Strand and how I think it may function, both from a scientific and a philosophical point of view. Obviously we don't have very much information yet, but I believe we have enough to speculate*[.](https://imgur.com/a/nij9Yqe)

During last years showcase we were treated not only to the new destination on Neptune but also our second Darkness ability: Strand.

Now we are told something vitally important that I want to preface before I continue:

&gt;""When you play through Lightfall, you are discovering this power for the first time. No one in the universe, ever in the history of Destiny, has used Strand before.""

We are pretty explicitly told that no one **in the universe** has ever used Strand before. I'm not exactly sure what that means in a game that has parallel universes as a core part of it's lore, but rest assured I am not going to be making a case for where we might have seen Strand used before or how it might be linked to any green phenomena.

With that out of the way, lets get into what we are actually told about Strand.

# Strand &amp; The Weave

&gt;""Strand is psychic energy that forms this extra dimension, this sort of matrix that connects everything together. It connects all living beings and all minds, and you the guardian are sort of gaining the knowledge and gaining the power to peer into this alternate psychic universe and begin to pull on these threads and tug on these wires that are connecting all these living beings""

We are even given some nomenclature for this ""extra psychic dimension"". It's called **the Weave.**

Guardian's are not only able to perceive the strands of the Weave but they are also able to pull at the strings and manipulate them in order to do a few interesting things.

Broodweavers manipulate the Weave using their mind and can twist Strand into sentient creatures called Threadlings. Threadrunners are masters of grasping the threads weaving new ones in order to traverse their environment. Berserkers tear at Strand to manifest claws they use to sever their victims from the Weave itself.

We also see some other unique abilities. We can hold enemies in abeyance, temporarily suspended in a tangled web. We can weave Strand into woven mail for flinch resistance and tangled balls of strand left from unraveled enemies can be weaponized in the environment.

We are also told something else that is very interesting in regards to the grappling hook:

&gt;Since you are seeing into this cosmic web, you are able to grapple at any point because the cosmic web exists everywhere. Even if there is not an object there, it will hook onto that web and pull you forward.

This means that the Weave is everywhere. It's not only connected to individual minds but it's lattice stretches across every point in space and time.

So piecing this altogether, what is Strand?

# Quantum Strands of Fate

Firstly it should be said that Strand may have a mythological basis as it bears a striking similarity to the Fates in Greek mythology who wove the threads of human lives and determined the destinies of both gods and mortals alike.

Clotho spun the thread of life, Lachesis measured it and Atropos who cut it with her shears!  The Fates were regarded as powerful beings who determined the length of a person's life and the events that occurred during it. Similar traditions can be seen in Norse mythology with the Nornir.

It seems very fitting as a power considering Guardians make their own fate that we might have mastery over the threads of fate itself!

There are also other interesting parallels. The symbol itself looks oddly like a strand of DNA. The colour and concept is also reminiscent of the movie the Matrix where all minds are connected in a digital simulation. I believe these are all meant to convey the idea that Strand is the very DNA of the universe and that we are all interconnected.

But like many things in Destiny, I was interested in whether there might be a scientific basis. One problem however is that ""psychic energy"" is not exactly scientific. Nevertheless I believe there is a scientific basis and a reasonable philosophical connection that might explain how the threads might connect.

What's more I was given hope during the press release when it was stated that Strand can form tangles.

&gt;The trailer also showcases some new Strand verbs like tangles, which are **bundles of quantum strands** left over when enemies unravel.

The use of the word Quantum means that the strands that we manipulate are at the quantum level and affect reality at the smallest subatomic scale.

# String Theory

My initial thoughts after seeing the reveal of Strand was that it might be connected to String Theory. Many other Guardians have made similar assumptions based on the aesthetics alone. But I want to show why I believe this assumption is the correct one.

String Theory is a theoretical framework that tries to explain the fundamental building blocks and forces that govern the quantum world. Put simply, String Theory suggests that the point-like particles that make up our universe are themselves made up of tiny one-dimensional objects known as **strings**.

What's more these quantum strings can be compared to literal strings in many ways.  When a guitar string is plucked, the initial energy from the pluck creates a range of frequencies in the string and produces a standing wave pattern. But this pattern quickly settles into a **resonant frequency**, where the greatest amount of energy is stored in the string.  This resonant frequency determines the pitch of the note that is heard. By changing the **length**, **thickness**, and **tension** of the string, the resonant frequency can be altered, allowing the guitarist to produce different notes.

Just like the strings on a guitar, quantum strings can vibrate and resonate at different frequencies. The vibrations of quantum strings are believed to be what we perceive as the fundamental particles like electrons or quarks. The length and tension of the string can determine fundamental properties of the particles themselves like mass, charge and spin.

So if the resonances of tiny strings determine the particles that make up everything in the material world, then we can almost think of the universe as the tune of some vast metaphysical symphony or [Song of Creation](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/ixi-the-unmaking).

What's more, most string theories suggest that the quantum strings can vibrate in **multiple dimensions**. This is one of the defining features of string theory, which sets it apart from other theories in physics.

# Extra Dimensions

In the earliest version of string theory, known as [bosonic string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosonic_string_theory), the theory required 22 dimensions to explain all the fundamental forces of nature. However, later developments in the theory resulted in the introduction of fermions (particles usually associated with matter) and this led to the creation of [Superstring Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstring_theory), which reduced the number of dimensions required to 10 in total: **9 dimensions of space and 1 of time**. Later M-theory was introduced which would introduce an 11th hidden dimension.

The concept of extra dimensions can be a daunting one as we are only used to the three dimensions of a space (length, width and height) and the fourth of time that together describe the four dimensional spacetime of our universe. But it is possible to [visualize](https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/physicists-outline-10-different-dimensions-and-how-youd-experience-them/) what these extra dimensions might entail.

* **Fifth dimension**: You can see other possibilities for our world and see similarities and differences with our world and other possible ones. You can move forward and backward in time.
* **Sixth dimension**: You move along a plane of possibilities, where you can compare and contrast them. All possible permutations in the universe are evident.
* **Seventh dimension**: Possibility of other universes where physical forces and laws of nature like the speed of light or gravity can be different. All possible permutations for these universes are clear.
* **Eighth dimension**: Plane of all possible histories and futures for each universe, branching out into infinity.
* **Ninth dimension**: All universal laws of physics and conditions in each universe become apparent.
* **Tenth dimension**: Everything becomes possible and imaginable.

In other words, at the higher dimensions, youd witness every possible world future, past, and present simultaneously! But why do we only observe our boring three dimensional space?

Well according to String Theory, these 6 extra dimensions of space are [compactified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactification_(physics)) or curled up like a ball of yarn which essentially hides these extra-dimensions from view while still influencing the physics of our three dimensional world. This manifold of six-dimensional space is known a [Calabi-Yau Manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold).

# Calabi-Yau Manifold

The Calabi-Yau manifold is one of our main links with String Theory in the universe of Destiny. In fact there are many references to it found in both [Kuang Xuan's Logbook](https://www.destinypedia.com/Kuang_Xuan%27s_Logbook) released during Shadowkeep and the more recent [Witch Queen Collectors Edition booklet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDF2gZFAVhn6vXjVdgWXO5P1Fdb6VFSMRTyx88Im0es/edit).

[Kuang Xuan](https://www.destinypedia.com/Kuang_Xuan) was the commander of the [K1](https://www.destinypedia.com/K1) project and her logbook details the discovery of a Darkness artifact found on the moon called the [Anomaly](https://www.destinypedia.com/Anomaly_(artifact)). It also details their attempts to study it as well as the catastrophic effects on both Kuang and her crews psyche.

The anomaly artifact would eventually be contained in a large polygonal structure seen at the center of the Crucible map of the same name by the Clovis Bray corporation. But before that the artifact was described as follows:

&gt;A black spherenothing could be simplerand yet it is awesome, unspeakably complex, compactly infinite, full of as many things as it could possibly contain.

The crew would study the artifact in shifts to reduce the noetic effects it had on their psyche, such as insomnia , increased stress hormone levels, hallucinations and nightmares. But eventually they started to get a picture of how this Darkness artifact operated.

&gt;Yan and Loftus are making progress on the ""distant source"" that communicates with the article. Their models describe the signal as **a ripple moving through a six-dimensional manifold present at every point in our familiar four-dimensional spacetime**. I almost understand it. But I am too much a creature of motion; too attached to the space I know.

Essentially this artifact of Darkness was an inter-dimensional transceiver not too dissimilar to the orb we recovered from the Lunar Pyramid. Unbeknownst to the K1 crew something very dark and very sinister was witnessing them from the other side. But we get more details on this artifact:

&gt;Tomorrow we will begin the dig. I don't understand the ""extra-spatial"" activity we detected, or the Clovis Bray scientists who speak of transmissions that ""**propagate through Calabi-Yau sixspace.**"" Maybe no one understands it. I have no expectations. I am prepared.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- - -  
&gt;  
&gt;Yan and Loftus believe they can replicate the article's **Calabi-Yau** **transceiver capabilities** in a machine they've started to build.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- - -  
&gt;  
&gt;Yan and Loftus are certain that the Site Two antenna receives exactly the same transmissions as the original alien artifact. **But we still have no idea how this stubbornly four-dimensional object accesses the six extra dimensions of the Calabi-Yau manifold**. Our antenna, like the artifact, simply shuffles its internal state through an apparently arbitrary series of gravitational and electronuclear permutations. These unified-force events were probably common in the early universe, but they have no real significance now. **Yan theorizes that they are like** **a password, recognized by** **some strange network that exists in the Calabi-Yau manifold**.

So quite clearly we have a link not only between Darkness and the Calabi-Yau manifold, but to String Theory itself. We are treated to another mention of this six dimensional manifold by Cowlick during his analysis of Stasis.

&gt;The crystalline structure of the Stasis material is both spatial and temporal: it forms ordered patterns in three dimensions, and those patterns evolve over time without outside energy input. I've tried bootstrapping several models, but when I compare the predictions to the actual behavior of the crystal, the R-factor is always garbage. (I don't have the equipment to **open up the Calabi-Yau manifold** and peek at **extra dimensions** here, sorry. Maybe I'd glimpse **the paracausal truth of the Darkness and start dividing in half until you had a planet full of Cowlicks and Truces all complaining.**)

But this isn't our only link to String Theory. In fact, we get description of another String Theory term in the Unveiling lore:

# The Dilaton Field

In String Theory, there is a number known as the [coupling constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_constant). It essentially determines the strength of the **interaction between strings**. This coupling constant is often associated with a scalar field known as the [Dilaton Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilaton).

The value of the coupling constant can change over time due to the dynamics of this field, and this can result in another phenomenon known as [symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_breaking). Symmetry breaking is important to String Theory because it paints a picture of how our universe went from the higher dimensional symmetrical state it was in shortly after the Big Bang to a lower dimensional asymmetrical one.

Symmetry breaking is believed to have played a role in the creation of a wide range of particles in the universe, including both bosons and fermions that make up the fundamental particles and forces of our reality. It's even believed to have led to creation of the Higgs boson which was responsible for giving particles **mass!**

This can be a lot to take in, but Unveiling gives us an account that this is precisely what happened at the beginning of time in no uncertain terms:

&gt;Our trampling feet made waves in the garden, which were the fluctuations around which the infant universes coalesced their first structures. **The dilaton field yawned beneath existence**. **Symmetries snapped like glass.** Like creases, flaws in space-time collected filaments of dark matter that inhaled and kindled the first galaxies of suns.

Furthermore, we are giving a description that perfectly explains the origin of the Destiny universe and how higher dimensions gave way to the multiple universes and timelines that braid them, consistent with String Theory.

&gt;In the wet pop of grapes and the smear of berriesin the perturbation of the field that was the garden before the first tick of time and the first point of spacewere the detonations that made the universes. **Each universe was pregnant with its own inflationary volumes and braided with ever-ramifying timelines. Each volume cooling and separating into domains of postsymmetric physics**, all of which were incarnations of that great and all-dictating bipartite law that states only: exist, lest you fail to exist.

So now I have explained String Theory and established how fundamental it is to the lore of Destiny. It helps explain it's origins and may even hint at the paracausal truth of the Darkness. It's easy to see how the quantum strands of the Weave might be interwoven with space and time and stretch across dimensions in the same way that quantum strings are believed to in String Theory. It's also easy to see how tugging on these strings and changing the length and tension of them might actually have some fundamental effects on reality itself!

But we still have the elephant in the room. What is it's relationship to consciousness?

# The Hard Problem Of Consciousness

Consciousness is a highly complex and still poorly understood phenomenon. Despite advances in neuroscience and psychology, the nature of consciousness and how it arises from the functioning of the brain remains a mystery. Scientists have made progress in understanding how brain activity relates to conscious experiences, but **why consciousness exists** in the first place and what it actually is remains an open question.

This is known as the hard problem of consciousness.

It is considered ""hard"" because there is no widely accepted explanation for how this occurs and some experts believe that it may be beyond the reach of current scientific understanding. In fact, it is a philosophical question of how subjective experiences, such as feelings, emotions, and perceptions, emerge from purely physical processes in the brain.

To illustrate, let's imagine a robot that looks and behaves exactly like a human. It can have conversations, perform tasks, and make decisions but ultimately it doesn't have any experience of the world. It doesn't have any subjective feelings or emotions. This is what we call a [philosophical zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie): a being that acts like it has consciousness, but doesn't actually have any subjective experience.

The hard problem has been explored many times in Destiny and was a particular challenge to Clovis during the creation of Exominds:

&gt;Early attempts at uploaded consciousness were haunted by fears thatthe upload would suffer ""cryptic loss of qualia"": the unseen death of thefirst-person, conscious mind. The upload would then become a so-calledbillboard, a flat imitation. \[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Many researchers refer to this criterion as the ""zombie detector.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem with exominds is that they quickly stop passing thezombie test.

It ultimately led to the death of Clovis' son:

&gt;The driver of this degenerative loop is a process we call ""billboarding."" \[...\] The exomind-despite acing the Turing test-no longer meets ISO standards for consciousness. It is a **philosophical zombie**.

Feel free to read more on this in [The Mysterious Logbook](https://www.destinypedia.com/Mysterious_Logbook) but the reason I bring it up was because the solution to this ultimately came from the paracausal force Clovis called Clarity... and we call Darkness.

Even back then there were hints that Darkness was related to consciousness but what I wanted to understand was how consciousness works in Destiny. In order to do that we need to first understand the proposed philosophies that seek to explain the hard problem.

# Physicalism &amp; Dualism

Traditionally there were to major perspectives on this: Physicalism (or Materialism) and Dualism.

[Physicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) states that consciousness can be reduced to and completely explained by physical processes and interactions, in our case the chemistry and structures of our brains. Now the majority of scientists agree that consciousness is closely tied to brain activity. But both science and the physicalist theory struggle to explain how subjective conscious experience, or qualia, emerges from purely physical processes.

The aforementioned philosophical zombie is one such thought problem that challenges the physicalist view.

[Dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) on the other hand posits that reality can be divided into two distinct substances or entities. Physical matter and non-physical consciousness. Mind and matter. A form of dualism, Cartesian Dualism even supposes that the mind is capable of existing independently of the body. At first glance this seems to get closer to the world of Destiny and how consciousness is treated.

However Dualism has problems too, even for Destiny. It supposes that both the mental world and physical world are both separate and distinct and can not be reduced or explained by the other. This seems to be in stark contrast with the world of Destiny where there is a clear interaction and connection between the physical world of creation and the mental world of consciousness. The Light and the Darkness are two sides of the same coin and their interaction can be seen in many aspects including Throne Worlds and the Ascendant Plane.

Years ago I wrote an essay analyzing the symbols of the Deep Stone Crypt and tried to make a case for a Cartesian Dualist view of consciousness and proposed that [Clarity solved the Mind-Body problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k9lepe/deep_stone_crypt_symbols_reveal_why_clarity_is/). Seth Dickinson [commented on my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/k9lepe/comment/gf8znqh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and told me something that has stuck with me till this day:

&gt;this whole essay seems to start from the premise that Cartesian dualism is real. But it ain't. It ain't real.

But with what we know now about Destiny it's clear that there is at least some distinction or duality between mind and matter. So if it's not Cartesian Duality then what is it?

There are other theories. [Idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism) for instance posits that the material world is an illusion completely fabricated by our minds. I think with what we know we can safely rule that out. But there is one that presents a middle ground between both Physicalism and Dualism and I believe perfectly explains not only how consciousness functions in Destiny, *but goes further* and can explain Strand.

# Panpsychism

&gt;""The nature of this power supports our hypothesis that Darkness is specially bound to the consciousness that stretches in webs across space and time.""   [Eris Morn](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/interactions/evidence-board-report-steps-retraced)

[Panpsychism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism) is a philosophical position that holds that consciousness, or some form of subjective experience, is a **fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the reality** and is present in some form **in all things**, both animate and inanimate.  It is also suggests that the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe. 

In other words, it toys with the idea that consciousness isn't simply restricted to living things but that consciousness is a fundamental feature of physical matter down to individual particles. Just like particles have properties like mass, spin and charge, Panpsychism suggests that consciousness might also be a fundamental property.

That's not to say that an electron can think, but rather that there is subjective experience or qualia in everything and complex consciousness might emerge in the aggregation of matter. In fact the main challenge for panpsychism is the [combination problem](https://philpapers.org/browse/the-combination-problem-for-panpsychism) of how precisely fundamental consciousness compose, constitute or give rise to higher consciousness. 

Modern theories like  [Integrated Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory) expand on this idea and suggest that consciousness will emerge once the structure is sufficiently integrated, or unified, and so the whole is more than the sum of its parts. 

&gt; They mistake the vessel for its contents. They confuse the pieces with the whole.   [Delicate Tomb](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/delicate-tomb)

I believe there is precedent for this idea too in Destiny and is the missing link to String Theory.

We are told Strand is psychic energy that forms this extra dimension. If this is consistent with String theory which has 6 higher dimensions that propagate across space and time than perhaps one of those **is a psychic dimension**. Perhaps consciousness is an emergent property of strings vibrating in this dimension just like String Theory also defines a particles mass and charge.

We can almost visualize consciousness as a kind of fundamental force then that permeates reality. It also provides the link between the material world and the mental world and explains how will gives form.

We see hints of this everywhere in Destiny too.

# Psychic Fingerprints

Witch Queen introduced us to deepsight which allowed us to relive memories or ""psychic fingerprints"" linked to objects in the world such as the Sagiras shell, the shard that killed Savathûn and the ossified white worm. We also collected qualichor, a material substance that contains subjective experiences.

&gt;The Alembic bubbles and churns. Degraded strands of experience withina thrash of pain, the smell of tears on hot stone, a Thrall's first breathtickle your Deepsight. The brew smells like defiance and last words.

And what happens when you concentrate enough of it?

&gt;If you concentrate enough of it in the Memory Alembic, you can uncover long-forgotten memories.

We also see consciousness emerge from dark matter dust in the form of the Nine.

&gt;I am.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I.  
&gt;  
&gt;At first this is all the loop of dust can calculate. It is the hardest thing in the universe for the dust to make a loop at all, because, like a gust of wind or a river, it was only meant to move one way. For a mind to function, the end of one thought must alter the beginning of the next: so, like rivers, like wind, the Nine could not have minds until they could make loops.  
&gt;  
&gt;But life arose on the worlds at the heart of the Nine, tiny complicated motions of ecosystems and metabolisms and computations. That life left mass-shadows in the wind of the Nine, plucking at them like harp strings. From these trembles of structure the Nine learned to seed enormous resonating waves, thoughts vaster than worlds.

We even learn that all planets, moons and asteroids in our system have some degree of consciousness.

&gt;These planets, moons, and asteroids upon which we leave our footprintsthey have an energy of their own. Will. Breath. Soul.  The greatest gaiaforms of our solar system are eight in numberor, if you prefer, ninebut asteroids and minor planets have them too.

On Presage

&gt;This page is blighted with mold and the imprint of a memory&

Panpsychism provides and explanation for why memories can be extracted from matter. It also explains why all consciousness is interconnected and can [stretch](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/transcripts/bound-in-sorrow-sever-rage-debrief-with-eris) over [vast distances](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/pathfinders-greaves).

Furthermore it may provide an explanation for why the bones of Ahamkara still whisper, why the reliquaries of Nezarec that held parts of his body held power, potentially the nature of Ghost revival and why keeping Savathun's body without destroying it seems to prevent revival.

I especially like this theory because of what it means for the Witness. The Witness is described as a cacophany of thought. Yet the Witness is not omnipotent. It's consciousness is still bound to the material world across a vast mycorrhizal network. It still has not ""witnessed"" everything.

Perhaps this is why the Witness is so interested in finding Neomuna.

# Conclusion

So if we consider panpsychism in the Destiny universe to be a fact, then it all makes sense. It means that consciousness can be treated like a scientific variable just like mass or electric charge. It means we can consider psychic fields in the same way we might consider electric fields or gravitational waves.

It means that consciousness, like the Light, really is everywhere and is propagated across space and time and even *other dimensions* along these quantum strands in accordance with String Theory. It also explains the link between mind and matter and why enemies can be unraveled or new consciousness can be weaved together!

I am reminded of the Secant Filaments lore:

&gt;Despite high-minded assumptions, mathematics is not an intrinsic language of the universe. It is how we describe the portions of the universe that we can observe. While numbers can track the abstract and find pattern in chaos, **they cannot account for fundamental aspects of reality such as compassion or justice**.  
&gt;  
&gt;What we see is the mushroom, the fruit of the fungus. The fungus itself is a vast mycorrhizal network of filaments growing and working unseen below the soil, often barely connected to the fruiting bodies we observe. Similarly, we have observed GhostsHive Ghosts included**without understanding the nature of the unseen filaments that may guide us.**

While this may superficially represent just the Egregore, I strongly believe this was foreshadowing the Weave and the unseen filaments of psychic energy that are fundamental to reality.

I believe Strand will allow us to use our own consciousness and mastery of Darkness as a gateway to this hidden psychic dimension called the Weave and *directly* manipulate it's quantum strands to weave or unravel existence itself in the same way we use Void to manipulate the quantum vacuum and distort time and gravity.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**TL;DR:** *Strand is a Darkness power that will allow Guardians to peer into a psychic extra dimension called the Weave. By peering into this dimension, the Guardians can manipulate the quantum threads of consciousness that connect all minds. This concept ties in with the idea of Superstring Theory, which posits that all particles that make up the universe are comprised of one-dimensional strings that can vibrate in ten dimensions. Additionally, the idea of Strand supports the philosophical position of Panpsychism, which states that consciousness is a fundamental and widespread aspect of the universe. According to Panpsychism, consciousness can be seen as a fundamental property of reality, like mass, charge, or spin, and can therefore be linked to the vibrations of quantum strings in this psychic dimension.*","DestinyLore",200,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/10ucnie/strand_unraveled_the_unification_of_string_theory/"

2023-02-05,1675631300,"The Teacher's pet gets to cheat? Okay, I'll help","Heres my petty revenge story from the 80s.

My parents moved pretty often around a very small part of a midwestern state. So I went to many tiny schools that varied wildly in how well they taught their students.

 In between my freshman and sophomore year we moved to the largest town in our area. I went from being in a Freshman class of just 25 students to a class of 300 students. It was a huge culture shock for me. None of the schools I had attended had any kind of drama club or classes.  I had no frame of reference for any kind of theater type stuff. Or many things that happened in the much larger school system really.

So my English teacher was the drama class/club Queen. Drama is her life. She works with local colleges to produce plays and stages yearly plays at the high school. She does community theater with all the local students and she has favorites. She is not shy about who she likes and who she hates. She would always fix the schedules so her favorite drama kids got her English class because she was so integral to their lives and crucial to their development. Which I thought was extra weird. Drama club seemed a little culty.  Also -- sometimes she would expose a kid who had messed up in a play during class.  She was a mean bully who played favorites.

I did very well in my English classes with her and was even bored somewhat by the curriculum. By about mid-year this Drama Teacher pulled me aside and said I should have been in a tougher class. She said there were no spots in the high track class, but that she would sit me in front of her desk. She would then teach me a little extra on the side so I wouldnt miss out. She said she would make sure I got into high track my Junior year. I was pretty excited to be singled out in such a huge class. I was also excited at the idea of high track for my next year. I really enjoyed English classes generally.

Well the extra work was totally bogus. She handed me The Scarlet Pimpernel and told me to write a report.  The book was boring and I wasnt getting extra credit for it.  I didnt much like her as a teacher. I quit reading the extra work that was only for me to do in this class and just pretended like I hadn't agreed to it.  She also quit talking about extra work but she kept me front and center at her desk.  I realized that next to me was her favorite student.  The star of our little drama club.

Lets call him Nick. She had been coaching Nick on drama since middle school and she would often tell us Nick would one day win an Oscar. Nick would always reply that he would thank her in his acceptance speech from the podium. She would smile and pat him and praise him. They had little secret jokes between themselves they would make mid-class. It was really weird.

So I come back from Christmas break and we are taking our first big test for the semester when it happens.

Nick casually leaned towards me and said sotto voce Hey, what is the answer to question 8.

Hes not speaking in a normal tone of voice, but hes not whispering. I am sitting right in front of the teachers desk. I could have reached out and touched it with a foot. I looked at Nick and then looked at The Drama Teacher. I waited and waited. She sat there as if she hadnt heard a thing.  None of the students near us said anything either.  Totally surreal.  If I got caught cheating I knew my mother would tear me up, but did it count as cheating if I just told this guy the answer??  

So I dusted off the Gen X motto and said, Whatever. 

I gave him the answer and waited for her to send us to the office or something. She just sat there so pleased with herself. I kept waiting for her to say something and as the semester went on  Nick kept asking for the answers to more and more questions on tests.

Now Im reviewing what has happened in this class and Im realizing. She figured out that I was good in this class and got me next to her Future Oscar Winner explicitly to help him cheat.

As the semester goes on  I studied harder and went with the flow, but I was pretty mad. She had straight up used me because I was the new kid.

I had a plan. A modest proposal if you will.

I started whispering the harder stuff to Nick so he wouldnt have to ask so much and would even angle my paper so he could see it better. All semester long. I wanted him to not worry about a single answer on any test. I wanted his cheating experience to be smooth as silk and she was thrilled that I figured out what she wanted.

Then it was finals time. Even though we were just high school students, we were in a University town so it was modeled on the university style. The final had huge weight on our overall grade. 

I gave him entirely wrong answers. Absurdly wrong answers in fact  while she sat right in front of me. I guess he had long ago stopped doing anything with the class material because he just wrote everything I said down.

She was a good actor because she must have been screaming inside listening to me. She never flinched or even raised her eyes to me. She never indicated she knew what was happening.

I enjoyed it so much. It felt so, so great. The most fun I ever had taking a test.

When the bell rang, she looked up and looked right at me.  I just smiled and smiled right back at her.

&amp;#x200B;

The aftermath. I have always wondered what she did about his test. There is simply no way she flunked him.  I am positive he failed that test badly.

She got me back though. I was never allowed in AP English or high track English my entire high school career. I was pissed but it was worth it.

Nick ended up going to New York because the stage called to him. He got on a few shows but ended up no where.

The best part though?  

There was someone in that class who did make it pretty big in Hollywood. It wasnt Nick and it wasnt me. Just a quiet kid who sat in the back of the class the whole time. I dont think I ever spoke to them the whole time we were in school together.  This kid was very introverted and not someone who you'd think Hollywood.

But every time I see this person getting Hollywood accolades  I toast to Nick, Future Oscar Winner and the Drama Teacher who \*nearly\* coached someone who made it. That must have really burned her up.","pettyrevenge",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/10unkir/the_teachers_pet_gets_to_cheat_okay_ill_help/"

But it doesnt bother me. 

Because you know what I call us? Survivors. 

About 500 years ago, our planet was destroyed by a meteor shower. Thousands of chunks of burning rocks bombarded our planets surface, wiping out our ecosystems and boiling our oceans. Over 99% of our population was killed in less than 48 hours. Amidst this great cataclysm, we loaded who we could on ships and took off, striking out into the dark unknown. 

Unfortunately, the galaxy may be vast, but areas fit to harbor life are limited. Almost all life sustaining planets had already been taken, and even the richest states were reluctant to take in close to 200 million refugees. We tried fruitlessly for decades to find ourselves a suitable home, but even when nations were willing to give us empty but technically survivable planets, we did not have the money or resources to build even a proper city, let alone rebuild our society. 

Out of necessity comes innovation. Pre-cataclysm our biological technology was already the best in the known universe. 

And so we decided to act. 

Our mode of invasion is simple. We send microscopic pods en masse via cloaked ships into a planets atmosphere. These pods take over the brains of developing embryos be it those in the womb or eggs. They have been pre-programmed with not only loyalty to our race, but a multitude of subtle improvements.

Some have their intelligence boosted, half of which occupy influential positions in businesses and large organizations, even those affiliated with politics and the military. These gather us the money and power needed for our takeover. The other half enter the fields of science and technology, clandestinely ensuring nations loyal to us are more advanced than those that are not. More have their social skills boosted, taking the roles of politicians, celebrities or even cult leaders. These gather the loyal following we need to sway public opinion. All our pods boost the diligence and dedication of the ones affected, thus ensuring they will always be the brightest, most diligent and most powerful beings on their planet. 

Following that, we appear, offering trade deals and partnerships. Our plants then guide the population into accepting said deals, and we begin to suck their planet dry. Loans that are never repaid. Trade deals that on paper look reasonable but are actually horrendously one sided. Tracts of prime land that look to be owned by a hundred different companies, each and every single one of which is a shell company run by us. 

And when some government booksman digs a bit too deep or some civilians protest, we simply manipulate a few nations into a war, and watch as whatever outcry we might attract fades into the background. It doesnt matter if a few nations collapse, a few cities are nuked, or if turmoil engulfs entire continents, not when we still control the power and resources. 

And even those who know of our true nature, a select few of our victims and their close allies, are not widely believed. Our pod technology is secret, vastly beyond the mind hijacking tech of any other known species. What is easier to believe, that a spacefaring race without even a home to settle on is systematically sucking several civilizations dry of resources, or that a nomadic race is an easy target to blame societal collapse on?

This method has served us well for centuries. We have left a trail of dozens of planets behind us, colonies of an empire that few even know exist. Our facade of a homeless, roaming swarm of ships have earned us intergalactic pity and aid, to the point where we could have settled on multiple planets decades ago, but have kept on being nomads for greater profit and ease of invasions. 

Roughly fifty years ago, we set up maps and planned our next target. The choice was obvious, a planet named Earth. It was relatively large, well populated with ample natural resources, and was the closest to the main swarm. We identified several key splits between its continents along the lines of race, culture, ideology and religions, which would be simple to exploit for maximum control. 

So we did what we usually did, send out swarms of drones, infiltrate their babies minds and start planning our takeover. 

That was fifty years ago. Two months ago, the fleet slowly began the long and arduous journey to Earth, it was an isolated planet after all. Last week, we showed up in Earths orbit, prepared to activate the sleeper signals and begin our conquest. There was only one problem.

We couldnt find any. 

All of our drones were uncontactable, each and every single drone infected baby had seemingly ceased to exist, we could not find even a single one. 

It took us a week before a startling finding appeared. All the babies we had infected were linked to gravesites across the planet. They were all dead, killed before we arrived, and in a way that had not seemed to impact the human psyche at all. 

You know what scares us the most? 

Humanity is not contacted yet, meaning the Universe Council of Planets has not officially inducted it into the wider space community. The humans should have no idea aliens even exist, let alone have any way of countering us. 

So the question now remains. Our infiltrators are all dead. Humanity seems to be trucking on just fine, the only impact we can find being that their population growth was being recorded as below average five decades ago.

So how did they discover us? Or more terrifyingly, if they hadnt discovered us, what led them to kill enough children to wipe out our entire invasion?","HFY",51,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1176ucu/it_was_smothered_in_its_cradle/"

**Human Games**

The galactic database was boring, deliberately so. Endless dry statistics, endless animations and walkthroughs. By the time he had left his first clutch, he was ready to leave all the basics to AI and concentrate on getting better at asking the right questions. Today was different as he waited to add an entirely new database.

The Human Contingency had refused to share their files for what they claimed to be hardware, software and security incompatibility. They had tried to demand that everyone else change, that millions of worlds should convert to their standards. They had conjured up imaginary monsters and fantastical disasters. Strange creatures known as Worms or worse, Hackers would arise from the dark and wreck, steal or burn all data. The galactic community had laughed at them but the humans had doubled down and rendered all traffic one-way under severe criminal and trade sanctions. Then they built beautiful and free stations that simply absorbed galactic data for their population and burned every line of code trying to leave. Today would be the test.

After nearly half a lifetime in discussion, the humans had proposed a test, a demonstration that they were telling no lies, that data could and would be weaponised against the reluctant community. They volunteered to fund a control, a nexus of the two systems. They refused to build it, stating that all data would become invalid if touched by human hands, they refused to even discover the location only insisting that it was on the main networks and that it had firewalls that could be physically destroyed the moment the experiment exceeded its parameters. The human government refused to comment on the expected duration of the experiment but their bookies and gambling houses were only bickering about which fraction of a second it would take.

He was now sitting in the most important chair the tech world had ever seen. He would turn on the networks, the finest emulator that his entire profession could develop. They had cloned and anonymised data from thousands of worlds and run them seamlessly together. One look at the data and you would be convinced you were looking at a major planet, the hub of a quadrants trade and science. A second look would have you wondering if the universe that we all lived in sat on some bureaucrat's desk in some unknown dimension.

The human government has announced it is standing down all official network systems. They are leaving the networks open to their general population but all state and military networks have gone offline. Were they supposed to do that?

He shrugged, No. I mean, we didnt ask them to. Perhaps they are afraid we will find out things they dont want to share. The human database has only dropped by a couple of points, not even within our margin of error. The Nexus is a go. He looked up at his Directors and the sole human appointed to observe the results. It was the human that leaned forward, Please activate your recording. The attacks have already begun and I require the data.

A quick glance at the screens showed nothing, The Nexus is not open yet. Attack is impossible.

The human grunted and swore softly, My blessed friend, now that they know where it is they will have found out who built it and persuaded them to surrender or just stolen their credentials. They are already in. You just havent seen them yet. It's our worst-case scenario and forty years of us telling you differently hasnt changed a damn thing. Earth says to open the Nexus when ready.

A light on his dashboard turned green. With little ceremony, he began cutting through the authorisations required until finally he was faced with a question:

***Do you wish to proceed?***

He prayed to the rubber duck of his profession and said yes. The network flashed on the screens as the two data systems met and translated each other, as half-cooked algorithms met half-baked hardware. It was clear which side was winning when the green of Earth systems adapted and overcame all resistance and the Nexus began spitting out thousands of terabytes of data in all directions.

He fumbled with the protocols to close the firewalls but his system refused to acknowledge him. The doors had been prised off and the Galaxy lay helpless as the human data stream poured from the Nexus.

All systems rebooting

Admin control removed

Admin now *HFY/WarnedYou*

Nexus is now designated as *Pornhub Central/Brave New Worlds*

New Directories are available: *PaNcaKes Nd fUrries foR U*

The human seemed amused and shook his head as he entered a code into his Comms. Deep in the server farm that supported the experiment an EMP field ripped out and crushed the machines. Nexus died in the blink of an eye.

Everything in the command centre also died a sudden death until the local systems were repaired and linked up. Nexus was gone.

Hello? Are you still there?

\----------------

The human seemed relaxed as the disgruntled Xenos of the community were obliged to attend what it called a *Post-Mortem.* The translation didnt add to the joy of the event. One of the Directors attacked first, You lied! You knew where our system was and planted a damn bomb in it! The experiment is invalid!

The human poured himself more coffee and looked around, There was no bomb. Some of our more enterprising idiots met one of the more gullible of your contractors. They stole the designs for a server farm from us and sold them to you. It included an EMP bomb that relied on& He checked his notes, nineteen different systems all running on full power at the same time. That would never happen in testing so we knew it was for today. We took control of it and locked out anyone else.

The Xenos were all shouting together at that point so he held up his hand, Please, the ones that sold the design to you also came to us and we paid them a not inconsiderable sum and then employed them. We quarantined the information and deemed it an accurate reflection of the test. He looked around, The purpose of which was if you will take a moment to recall, to see if your systems were as secure as you thought. That it could withstand a simple connection to our dataspace.

He opened a new screen, Let us watch what actually happened.

That is the phishing attacks before the Nexus opened. You missed most of them because it never occurred to you to monitor the traffic. We did.

As soon as the official human sites had left the gateway unguarded a flood of data had begun spilling out in all directions.

The location was discovered and a pipeline formed. The inert Nexus was surrounded by code, some malicious and some just curious.

The human paused the display, This is where they raided your contractors and staff. That obviously worked since then this happened& He resumed the playback.

The Nexus activated and was immediately swamped by credentialed downloads that sank the pathetic security and took control of the firewalls. Other programs began grabbing all the data they could and sending it home. Huge data swaps peaked and then burst-transmit to new targets. Then it crashed.

The human pointed at the sudden stop. That's when I blew your servers, it was far too late to solve anything with software. A hard burn was required and I personally would never even risk reusing one of those servers again. On Earth, if this had happened, we would drag them outside and physically destroy every single component. If it was necessary we would strip our workforce to their socks and jocks and give them hammers to do it. This is such a case.

\---------------

It was a much more sombre meeting ten days later when the full damage had been accessed.

The human remained unchanged but the Xenos looked older and if possible more unhappy. Some of our governments have declared this an act of war. We prefer to believe that you acted in good faith, something I dearly hope to be true. I must add that you are effectively speaking as a Witness for the Defence right now. There are those that invested heavily in our success and are now reaping the rewards of failure.

The human stood and gave the meeting a swift bow, I will start, then, at the beginning. Our space exploration has always been controlled by our central powers. They may have been awkward, conniving and at odds but they were not malicious. When our early fleet met you and discovered your entirely open network we were amazed, delighted even. We thought you a collection of idealists, free with your data, and glad to share.

Imagine our surprise when we found out you thought it was hidden! That it was encrypted even. My God, our children's toys are more seriously protected. We locked your systems down hard on our side, we imposed horrific penalties on anyone that dared to connect to them. Our people thought we were hiding monsters and we couldnt explain that we were protecting innocents. If we explained how basic your systems were then you would have been destroyed. We allowed them to believe you were monsters instead.

He took a sip of his water, Then we tried to warn you. We showed you our systems, and we proved it time and time again but you wouldnt listen. Not until we suggested we fund the great boondoggle that was Nexus. A feeding frenzy of stuck-up Xeno tech charlatans selling you your own belief in the strength of your systems. You never even asked where all your good, ethical and capable people went when they saw the wind change. We hired them.

He pulled up the screen grabs of the event, Within 4.8 seconds you had lost any control of the Nexus. Even as you turned it on it was working for us. Im guessing you have still no idea how it happened because the gutless wonders that you employed to build it are busy blaming each other. We will furnish you with a full technical analysis. A real one.

He nodded and moved to sit but was interrupted by the stung chairman, So this is where your governments went? Why your militaries all went dark? To coordinate this attack?

The human raised his eyes to heaven and turned back to the Committee, You truly dont understand. This was a big deal for your peoples because you failed but we had, and have, told our people nothing. They thought our funding for the Nexus was a water reclamation project on Mars. We shut down all our servers so that we didnt accidentally respond to the attacks and kill them off. What happened to you is what happens every day to every system on my homeword. You didnt even make the news cycle. This was not coordinated, this is just& the shit that happens when you open up your system to our public.

The Committee seemed to mumble to itself before arriving at a conclusion:

We will await your analysis before judgement.

The Chairman seemed to hesitate for a moment but he added, Please, I now believe every word you have spoken to be true but the loss of the Nexus&if not your governments or military then who? Who attacked us?

The human turned off his microphone and grimaced, No one and everyone. Gamers seeking out new networks, Influencers seeking a new gimmick. Bored tech staff. Teenagers with a god complex. This is all a game to them. Hide and seek. Crosswords, sudoku, chess and poker all rolled into one. Human games.

He seemed depressed for a moment, Dont worry, our firewalls are back up. Some malware might have made it off the Nexus but we are training your people since you didnt. Goodnight.

**Update:** made a super quick (by no means comprehensive) comment below on some of the other board members of LedgerX/FTX US Derivatives:

https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/10oei0a/_/j6fjjlc/?context=1
  

FTX US Derivatives (aka LedgerX) got its approval from the CFTC. This happened after the co-founders (https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledgerx-places-founders-on-leave-following-public-cftc-woes ) of LedgerX Paul and Juthica Chou were placed on leave (ousted? Check me on that.) from the company (they had issues getting regulatory approval IIRC, see above link).  Larry Thompson somehow was then made chairman.  He left the DTCC for about 1-2 years (after being there since 1981&) before running LedgerX. 
  

https://cryptomode.com/ledgerx-puts-its-founders-on-forced-leave-and-appoints-interim-ceo/

  
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ledgerx-announces-change-to-executive-leadership-300971599.html

Note: Youll see below that there are *others* who are also claiming co-founder status for LedgerX. The articles above dont seem to mention any other founders, so its currently unclear to me if this is just shoddy reporting, or what, and its also unclear in general from the info below whether these other individuals claiming co-founder status of LedgerX are, in fact, actually other co-founders.
I cant seem to find who the exact team of founders are from a quick search.
  

https://crypto.marketswiki.com/index.php?title=LedgerX

   
https://aithority.com/technology/cryptocurrency/ledgerx-officially-appoints-zach-dexter-as-ceo-and-president-larry-e-thompson-to-remain-chairman/
  
**According to the above link it sounds like Larry Thompson got his position at LedgerX, worked as CEO, then went to chairman of the board.** Actually, just read the super short article above, and make up your own mind, because to me the entire thing just seems off. I dont know.
  
Again, more details around how these decisions were made, and by who, would certainly be interesting.
  
  

___

As a side note, remember: 

LedgerX/FTX US Derivatives currently has an agreement with the CFTC where they do not have to report their swaps (along with another entity, Kalshi). Notably, LedgerX offers binary options in crypto, among other things. Source for swaps reporting notice:
  
https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8382-21
  
I should also add that FTX US Derivatives (aka LedgerX) has several other interesting board members. Including *another* individual from the DTCC and Robinhoods deputy general counsel:
  
Alongside Mr. Thompson, the members of the Board of Directors are:

-	Keisha Bell, Managing Director, Head of Diverse Talent Management and Advancement, **DTCC**
-	Lucas Moskowitz, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel at **Robinhood**
-	Bryan Bishop, CTO/cofounder at Avanti Bank &amp; Trust (now known as Custodia - a Crypto Bank, recently notable for applying for a master account with the Federal reserve, and then subsequently suing the federal reserve over what they claim is a delay in their application. From June 2022: https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/crypto-bank-sues-federal-reserve-over-delay-master-account-application ) Custodia offers institutional investors custody and settlement services for digital assets
-	edit - looks like application for federal reserve membership was denied 2 days ago. Fed master account application is still pending. https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/27/custodia-bank-denied-federal-reserve-system-membership/
-	also of note, Bishop also serves on the board of avanti/custodia and... **He previously worked as a senior blockchain engineer and custody architect of LedgerX.** https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avanti-financial-group-announces-leadership-team-301025169.html
-	Zach Dexter, CEO of FTX US Derivatives (his linked in profile also lists him as a co founder of LedgerX&)
-	Joe Keefer, Trader at Grapefruit Trading
-	Jerome Kemp, President of Baton Systems
-	Bart Smith, Global Head of Strategy for Digital Assets for the **Susquehanna** International Group of Companies (""SIG"")
-	Mark Wetjen, Head of Policy and Regulatory Strategy at FTX US
  

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-us-derivatives-announces-board-of-directors-301463938.html
  
Another person perhaps of note at Avanti/Custodia:
  

&gt;	Chuck Thompson - position at avanti/Custodia:
co-founder, chief compliance officer and chief legal officer. 
  
&gt;	Mr. Thompson was CEO of Blockchain Consulting LLC and **was chief compliance officer of LedgerX, where he worked with Mr. Bishop.**
  

Some interesting ties there perhaps between former LedgerX/FTX US Derivatives employees and Avanti/Custodia. Maybe nothing, maybe something notable, not quite sure.
  

More on Avanti/Custodias leadership below, though in a quick search Im finding it hard to determine who comprises the board of directors. The board of any company is where the main decisions are made of course.

2023-02-23,1677192235,"I'm completing my junior year at my safety, y'all need to calm down","There is a tl;dr at the bottom for those of you who don't want my story, and if you can still read this text, I plan on responding to all (hopefully) comments with any questions or criticisms of my opinion. 

Ok so I, like many of you, was a obsessive user of A2C back in my senior year of high school (class of 2020). Not only was the first half of senior year the worst stretch of high school, it was, by far, the time in my life I was the most depressed. Congrats on making it through that. With decisions coming out soon, you are on the home stretch. 

But lets be real for a sec. I say you are on the home stretch and you give a little eye roll because you are incredibly stressed about the imminent future, and you may have to (god forbid) go to your safety. I'm hoping my story can quell at least a few of your stresses, and for those of you who read it and go ""oh this doesn't apply to me because my apps were good enough so im gonna get into at least one of my pics,"" this *especially* applies to you.

I was a typical A2C'er. 36 on my ACT (35/35/36/36), 10 APs (five 5's, three 4's, two 3's), president of the math club (my intended major), captain of the mock trial team (state champs woohoo), marching band, etc. (no hooks tho, just a white guy from utah). On paper I looked great, and I thought, just like many of you, that surely some college out there would want me. And this was three years ago, its gotten measurably worse since then. 

I put myself through hell to get my college apps in, and I applied to Harvard, CMU, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Tulane, (maybe a few others, its been awhile and I can't remember everything), and the University of Utah. I was under enormous pressure to succeed because both of my sisters went to T10s, and they figured I would too. 

Judging by how this post is going, you can already tell what happened. I was flat rejected from all those schools besides CMU (waitlisted then rejected), Tulane (the same, also wtf how did i get waitlisted from tulane), and the U of U, where I got a fucking sweet scholarship. 

I've reflected a lot on this because college is a big decision, and it would have been the single largest decision of my life if I was admitted to more than one university, and while I was still blissfully unaware of my college results, I was freaking the fuck out about how tf I am going to choose what college to go to (I believe this is where many of you are, hopefully you get into your reaches, but realistically, most of you wont). 

I was defeated when I only got into the U. I felt like I failed, my parents were stunned and disappointed, and I felt like I was going to go to a lousy school and not get the connections and education that I would have gotten at a T10. Little did I know that there is no such secret education at these T10s. I am a math major, and I am learning the exact same math as all the other math students around the country. There is no secret math, or secret science, or secret CS, or secret medicine that you will learn at these T10s. Your undergrad is all about learning your chosen area of study, you will learn it no matter what you do. (Turns out the U is a T40 program in math and I did not even know that when applying, i just applied cause i knew i needed a safety. news flash: safety does not imply bad). 

And we haven't even talked about the finances yet. Due to my good stats, I got an amazing scholarship worth about $60,000. Guys, thats sixty fucking THOUSAND dollars. that is a bonkers amount of money. That is close to a full ride at my university for four years, and if I had gotten into one of my reaches and decided to go there instead, I would be paying about that amount PER SEMESTER??? I'm sorry what? I am going to graduate debt free from college, something that many students at these top universities can only dream of. The money I make out of college will be all mine, and I do not have to stress heavily about that. When I was 17 and applying for all these places I figured I would just figure out how to pay, and while I probably could have, it would not be fun.

And the final, and probably most important, part of college. My emotional and mental health. I am *happy*. In hindsight, if every other college had also accepted me, I would still choose to go here. The friends I have made are all amazing, and I am not constantly stressed out about money or grades because I have enough time to do everything I need to do. This is absolutely the right place for me, and if I would have asked my high school self what I thought about that, I would never have considered that I would actually *like* my safety. 

Decisions are coming out soon. Stakes feel high, and I know many of you are little geysers of stress right now. I want to emphasize that if you choose, or only get into, your safety, it is far from the end of the world. You are all high achievers, and you will continue to succeed at your safety. If you are rejected from everywhere, your life is not over, it is only just starting (and again, I know that is an eye-rolly statement, but I almost never think about my high school life anymore. I am a completely different person in college and I love who I have grown up to be, even though I hated myself in high school).

2023-02-24,1677207763,"On September 5, 1936, 1-year-old Harry Browe was abducted from Detroit, Michigans Clark Park. Sadly, despite hundreds of tips and even several promising leads, he was never found. What happened to Harry?","On September 5, 1936, around 4:30pm, brothers Charles Browe, age 9, Edward Browe, age 7, and Harry Buddy Browe, age 19 months, departed from their Detroit, Michigan home to go to the park. While pushing Harry in his stroller, the three siblings walked from their house at 1468 17th Street, to Clark park, located approximately fourteen blocks away.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 6:30pm, a woman, accompanied by two young girls, approached Charles and Edward while they were playing on a set of swings with a small group of other children. According to the boys, the woman began immediately doting on young Harry, whose stroller was positioned next to the swings. After a brief conversation, the woman offered to pay for ice cream for all three of the Browe children and watch Harry.

&amp;#x200B;

With money in hand, Charles and Edward walked to a nearby confectionary to purchase the ice cream. After they returned and finished their cones, again the woman offered Charles money, this time to purchase candy. The woman instructed Edward to watch Charles as he crossed the street to ensure he safely made it across. Edward did so, however did not enter the store. Instead, he remained just outside the door. When Charles exited the store, Edward was suddenly in possession of three pennies. When Charles questioned where he got them, he explained a man walked up and gave them to him for more candy. The pair decided against buying more treats however and returned to the park.

&amp;#x200B;

As Charles and Edward approached the swings where they had left their baby brother, they found Harrys stroller empty. After a quick scan of the playground, they quickly realized that both the woman, and Harry, were gone. Approximately three hours after they had set out for the park, Charles and Edward returned home with the empty stroller, explaining to their parents, Robert, 35, and Alice, 27, what had happened. The Browes immediately summoned police.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles and Edward described the woman to investigators as being in her 30s, slightly heavy set, with blonde hair and glasses. She was wearing a blue and white dress, no stockings, and black shoes. They described the two young girls in her company as being around 7 and 11 years old. Both wore dresses, one brown, the other blue, and the pair donned matching black shoes and yellow stockings. The man who had given Edward the three pennies was described as having a cleft palate and dressed in a gray hat and dark suit.

The Browes could think of no reason anyone would want to abduct young Harry. The family lived in a modest, weathered home, and had no real money to speak of. While Robert worked as a steel worker, Alice was a homemaker who cared for their six children, which besides Charles, Edward, and Harry, included Robert Jr, age 4, Marion, age 3, and Irene, age 3 months.

Investigators thoroughly questioned young Charles and Edward on the chance the boys were lying about that evening's events. While the pair did mention Harry had fallen out of his stroller on the way to the park, they claimed he was uninjured. After several rounds of interrogation, detectives were confident the boys were telling the truth. 

Also questioned were two playmates of the Browe children who were present at the park that evening. Accompanied by their mother, Dolores and Joan Gallagher, ages 4 and 11, relayed the same story of a woman dressed in blue taking Harry. Another woman who was also at the park, told police she saw a man carrying Harry in his arms a short time after he vanished. She gave a similar description of the man who had given Edward the additional money for treats. 

An all out search quickly ensued with scores of police, volunteers, and even the local Boy Scouts aiding in the hunt for Baby Harry. Sadly, they found no sign of the missing infant, nor his supposed abductors. In the hopes to increase their search area, ten thousand circulars were distributed in several states. The flyers offered a reward of 650 dollars, and included a description of Harry; Age: 19 months, height: 2 ft 4 in, weight: 26 lbs, blue eyes, light brown/dark blonde hair. Wore: white romper, no stockings, black shoes.

The circular also included Harry had a missing fingernail on his left ring finger as well as a pair of unique, and prominent scars located behind each of his ears. Only three months prior to Harrys disappearance, he had undergone a mastoidectomy, a surgery that removes diseased cells from the air-filled spaces in your mastoid bone. The scars were a result of said surgery. 

Hundreds of tips poured in from people who claimed to have seen the missing child, including from nearby Indiana, and as far away as Canada. According to one man, he was confident he had seen Harry at a small gas station in Goshen, Indiana in the company of a man and woman driving a car with Michigan plates. Another call placed Harry in Evansville, Indiana, and yet another in Indianapolis. Investigators even traveled to Toronto, Canada to inspect babies participating in a rather unusual event called the Great Stork Derby, a contest held from 1926 to 1936 in which female residents of Toronto competed to produce the most babies in 10 years, in order to qualify for a bequest in a will of a millionaire who hosted the event. Sadly all of the leads proved to either be prank calls, or resulted in dead ends. 

Harrys grief stricken parents did everything in their power to get the word out about him. Alice went as far away as New York City to speak on a nationwide radio show, while Robert appealed to the kidnappers to leave the baby with any clergyman. He expressed his concern the kidnappers may not return Harry due to the constant onslaught of curiosity seekers that surrounded their house. In their desperation, the Browes even spoke to a psychic multiple times in the hopes she could offer some insight about the whereabouts of their missing baby. 

In the following days, and as any promising leads began to dwindle, a clue finally presented itself in the form of a postcard. On September 11th, Alice received a picture postcard from Detroit in the mail. The letter read in part;

Mrs Browe, 

Please forgive me for taking your baby. You cannot understand how it is to be without one. You have so many, surely you can spare this one. He is beginning to like us, we want you to know&.

The postcard was written in a female's handwriting and bore a purposely torn corner. According to investigators, it was not uncommon for kidnappers to use this method as a way of proving the identity of a baby later if their appearance had changed. However, this method was normally reserved for ransom cases, and the Browes had received no such request. Although investigators believed the letter may be legitimate, the writer was never found. 

In 1950, tragedy again struck the Browe family. While walking one evening, Alice and Robert were struck by an oncoming vehicle. Sadly Alice passed away at the scene, while Robert suffered several severe injuries including a broken pelvis and internal bleeding. Alices death left Robert to care for their children, which by this time had risen to 12 in number. However, left with debilitating injuries from the accident, Robert was unable to continue working. A short time later Robert and his children moved in with Alices mother, Marion. 

In 1952, Charles took a job driving a gasoline truck, using the money he earned to help his family as much as possible. Sadly, that year the Browes were hit with another devastating loss when Charles' truck collided with another vehicle, killing him instantly. In December 1952, Marion also passed away. That same month, a devastating fire destroyed a portion of the familys home leaving them without heat. Finally after a lengthy battle with the insurance company however, Robert was appointed the administrator of Marions meager estate. 

In 1962, a new promising lead came from a young man who believed himself to be Harry. Reporter Neal Shine, who as a child had been a former playmate of Charles and Edward and had written several first hand accounts of their demeanor after the disappearance, received a phone call one evening. The young man on the other end claimed to have seen the story about Harry, and was concerned he may be the missing boy. He was the same age, had blue eyes, bore scars behind each of his ears, and perhaps most compelling of all, told of a deathbed confession from the woman he believed to be his mother. According to the young man before her death she had told him You are some other womans baby. I took you. I have never been sorry, except for breaking that womans heart. 

After several phone calls between the two, the man told Neal he had decided he didnt want to complicate his life if it were true. Neal, however, took it upon himself to look for the young man, who he believed from their conversations, worked in a hotel kitchen. For six months Neal searched every hotel kitchen he could, hunting for a young man with scars behind his ears, however he found none. 

Robert passed away only two years later in 1964. Edward, in 1986. From what I have gathered, all but two of Harrys siblings have also since passed. There are, however, still members of his family actively seeking Harry, who today, would be in his late 80s. Their only hope is to finally have an answer to the question that has plagued their family all these years; What Happened To Harry?

2023-03-05,1678043171,"We found a cave to a world where Homo sapiens never evolved. We saw what the world became without us. It shocked us.","I was sitting outside the small entrance to the Optymistychna Cave with my radio equipment, shivering in the cold February air, and listened carefully to the strange, barely perceptible broadcast that came and went. My close friend, Dr. Nataliya Morozov, tried to keep warm by walking in circles and stretching her limbs. We had discovered the signals with one of our walkie-talkies by accident while exploring the cavea large and partly unexplored gypsum cave located in the Ternopil region of western Ukraineand since then we had spent our free time trying to pinpoint the source of these signals. We hadnt gotten any closer to an answer though. All we knew, after trying to pick up the signals from anywhere else, was that they were coming from somewhere inside the cave.

Lets start a fire, Oleksandr, said Nataliya. Its so damn cold.

Its back! I said, ignoring her request. Listen!

She rushed over to me and crouched down. We had invested in a better receiver since the discovery, one that could pick up weaker signals, and it had paid off. The voice coming through the static was much clearer, although still a complete mystery to us. It didnt speak either Ukrainian or Russian nor any other language we could recognize. The closest one was the indigenous Australian language Warlpiri, but after sending some recordings to an expert on that language we learned that although slightly similar they werent the same.

Our plan had been to gather a team of experts and venture into the caves deepest, most unexplored parts in an attempt to find whoever it was that was broadcasting these signals, but because of the Russian invasion, we had been forced to postpone our plans indefinitely. It wasnt safe enough for just the two of us to undertake such a risky expedition. All we could do under the circumstances was to record as much as possible of the strange voice and to study it.

While completely focused on the voice now, the deafening sound of a fighter jet roared overhead, interrupting our thoughts and causing us to jump in surprise. The noise was thunderous, a deep rumbling that vibrated through the ground and rattled our bones. We looked up and saw the jet streaking across the sky, leaving a trail of white vapor in its wake. This region was still relatively safe from the war, but the sight of the jet still fill us with unease. Just seconds later, there was an explosion. Another jet had been hitperhaps by a missile or anti-aircraft fireright above us, sending debris raining down and causing us to scramble for cover. When we looked up again, we saw the pilot parachuting down toward the ground.

Is it one of ours? I asked.

No, Nataliya said with concern in her voice. We need to pack up quickly and get back to the car.

I turned off the receiver and put my stuff back into my backpack as fast as I could. My heart was racing with fear and adrenaline. As we prepared to move out, the pilot touched down between us and our car. He quickly unhooked himself from his parachute and stumbled toward us with his hand reaching for a gun in his holster. We froze in terror for a second, unsure of what to do, and then we turned around and ran back toward the cave. The army had most likely sent out teams to capture him, which he probably knew and would do anything to avoid. Any witnesses that could report his whereabouts would be dangerous to him, so trying to talk to him was out of the question. We ran as fast as we could, but he was right behind us, closing in quickly. I could hear his heavy breathing and the sound of his boots pounding against the ground as he pursued us.

When we reached the entrance to the cave, we quickly ran inside and turned on our flashlights. The pilot followed us in, his gun now drawn and pointed in our direction. We could see the fear in his eyes, and we knew that he was just as desperate as we were. Even if he managed to kill us, or take us hostage, his chances of getting out of this situation were slim at best, but even so, he refused to give up and kept coming after us.

Without thinking, we began to make our way deeper and deeper into the cave, trying to put as much distance as possible between us and the pilot. The narrow passageways were dark and treacherous, and we stumbled and fell several times as we hurried along. Behind us, we could hear the pilot shouting and cursing, his footsteps echoing through the cavern. We knew that we couldnt outrun him unless we turned our flashlights off which we couldnt do, but we still kept pushing ourselves out of fear for our lives.

We kept going for what felt like an eternity, with the sound of the pilots footsteps getting closer and closer. Just when we thought we couldnt go any further, we saw a small crack in the cave wall that we could squeeze through. We quickly made our way through the narrow gapalbeit not without pressing our bodies to their limitsand as we emerged on the other side, we found ourselves in a large chamber. The chamber was dimly lit and there was a small hole in the ceiling that let in a beam of light from the outside. We looked up and saw a glimpse of blue sky, and it filled us with hope. We knew that we were still in danger, but the sight of daylight was a reminder that there was still a world outside the cave, and that we could still escape.

Can we get up there? Nataliya said while taking her backpack off. Help me up! Hes going to be here any moment now.

I nodded and offered my hands as a step for her to climb onto. She put her foot into my hands and pushed herself up, grabbing onto the edge of the hole. I pushed her up as she struggled to pull herself through the hole. Meanwhile, the pilot was yelling for us to give up, promising not to hurt us while at the same time cursing his predicament. He was close now. Once Nataliya was up, she extended her hands to help me climb up, and I grabbed onto her wrists as she pulled me up.

A gunshot echoed through the chamber, and we heard the bullet whizz past our heads. The pilot had entered the chamber and pulled the trigger. Nataliya and I pressed ourselves out of the hole and onto the rocky terrain outside. It was colder than before, and strong winds whipped our faces as we stumbled down the hillside.

We need to keep moving, I gasped, trying to catch my breath. That maniac is still after us!

The snow was blowing so hard in the wind that we could barely see more than a few feet in front of us. We had lost our bearings and couldnt orient ourselves in the midst of the blizzard. We discussed finding our way back to our car, but we didnt know which direction to head in. I looked back, seeing the pilotno more than a shadow behind all the snowsqueezing himself through the hole. Stumbling through the snow, we saw a strange structure looming in the distance. It was a huge metallic tower, unlike anything we had ever seen beforeespecially not in this area, which we knew better than most. We could barely make out its shape in the blinding snow, but it looked like it was at least a few stories tall.

What is that? Nataliya said.

We ran toward itit being our only hope of finding helpslipping and sliding on the icy ground. As we approached, we saw a small building at the foot of the tower. Its architecture was distinct with intricate details and ornate patterns I couldnt recognize.

What *is* this place? I asked when we got closer. This isnt supposed to

Nataliya looked at the top of the tower, seemingly so amazed by it that she had forgotten about our pursuer. This is it. Her voice was filled with wonder.

What? I said. We need to get inside and call for help.

Dont you understand, Oleksandr? Its& Its the *source*.

I felt a chill run down my spine. The source, of course. I couldnt wrap my head around what kind of place this was or how it could be that we had never seen it before, but it did look like some kind of radio tower. The pilot appeared as a silhouette inside the snowstorm, closing in on us.

Lets get inside quickly, I urged Nataliya, pulling her towards the building. Hes right behind us.

We reached the door of the building and tried to open it, but it was locked from the inside. Panic started to set in as the pilot approached us, gun still in hand. Then the ground beneath us began to shake, and we heard a deafening roar. At first, I thought the gunshot from earlier might have set off an avalanche from the top of the hill, but just as that thought crossed my mind something astonishing appeared in the icy mist. Nataliya grabbed my shoulder and pulled me toward her.

My God, she said. Those are mammoths!

We pressed ourselves against the wall to avoid being crushed, and thenamazedwe watched the herd stampeding toward us, their massive bodies causing the ground to tremble with each step. The pilot was caught off guard and stumbled backward, dropping his gun. He tried to crawl away from the approaching herd but to no avail. We lost track of him amongst the mammoths as they rampaged past us, their enormous tusks and trunks throwing up clouds of snow and ice.

Once everything had cleared, Nataliya and I cautiously ran up to where the pilot had been. We found him lying on the ground, alive but hurt. His arm was badly twisted, and blood seeped through his sleeve. We quickly realized that he was in no condition to pursue us.

We need to help him, I said. Lets drag him to the tower.

Those were freaking mammoths! Nataliya exclaimed, still in shock. How is that even possible?

I have no idea, I replied, trying to focus on the task at hand. Right now, we need to get this guy some help.

Dragging him toward the building, a growl cut through the air, causing us to freeze. The pilot tried to sit up and saw something that made him scream. Two large beasts slowly approached us, stepping out of the stormy winds like phantoms, their eyes fixed on the injured pilot.

T-those are cave lions, Nataliya stuttered. Thats what the mammoths were running away from. She turned to the pilot and grabbed him by his collar. Your gun! she yelled to his face. Do you still have your gun?

The pilot, still in a state of panic, shook his head. N-no, he said.

One of the lions charged toward us, its jaws opening wide as it prepared to attack. I braced myself for the worst, but just before it reached us, the door to the building was flung open, and a tall man dressed in the most peculiar wayin a white uniform and a green turbanstepped out and fired two shots into the air. The lions paused for a moment as if to consider their options, before turning and fleeing back into the storm.

The man proceeded to point his rifle at us. His facial features made me flinch. It was like no other face I had ever seen before. His features were strong and angular, his forehead sloping back from his prominent brow ridge. His nose was broad and flat, and his eyes were deep-set and hooded. He had a prominent chin, and his teeth were large and white. I couldnt place his ethnicity or origin, and there was something about him that made my heart skip a beat.

He spoke the same language we had heard over the receiver outside the cave, confirming this was indeed the source of the signals. We raised our hands over our heads. The pilot had to struggle to get up, and couldnt keep his broken arm up, but he yielded just like us. The man in the turban seemed just as unsettled by seeing us as we were seeing him. He yelled into the building. A woman wearing the same outfit joined him in the doorframe, took a look at us, and then ran inside again.

What in heavens name is going on? I whispered. Who are these people?

Its impossible, Nataliya said. The animals& She lowered her voice. This man doesnt belong to the same species as

The man yelled at us, maybe to shut us up, and was joined by two others also pointing their rifles pointed at us. I was so cold by now that my teeth were chattering out of control and my fingers were going numb. The pilot began speaking Russian, asking not to be shot, unaware that these people didnt understand his oras it seemedany other language we knew of. Nataliya hushed him.

Whats going on? he whispered in reply. Who are they?

Denisovans, Nataliya whispered back. Now shut up.

I looked at her, shocked. Denisovans? But they went extinct thousands of years ago!

I know, I know, she replied, but thats the only explanation for what we just saw. Theyre not human, at least not the same as us. We need to be careful.

The man in the turban approached us, his rifle still in our faces. He searched us, took our belongings, and then he spoke again and gestured for us to follow him. Reluctantly, we complied. The men led us into the building, which turned out to be a massive underground complex. The walls were adorned with intricate carvings and mosaics, depicting scenes of war and conquest. There were tools and documents scattered around, as well as what looked like large computers from fifty years ago.

We were brought to a room where the woman who had briefly looked at us was waiting. She gestured for us to sit, and then left the room, closing the door behind her. The pilot rushed to the door and banged on it, yelling to be released.

Calm down! Nataliya yelled. You really think thats going to work?

I sat down on the floor with my back against the wall. Nataliya, I said. Im trying to wrap my head around whats going on, but its just so surreal. How did we end up here?

Nataliya inspected the strange equipment. I dont understand it either, but from what weve seen I think its fair to say weve entered a realm where history took another turn somewhere. In our world, humanity outcompeted our closest hominid relativesthe Neanderthals and the Denisovansand we partly hunted the megafauna to extinction. Right? Now here& Its as if the footprint of man was never made. She pulled out a large sheet of paper that was rolled up among a bunch of other documents. Ah, look at this! It was a black-and-white map. I got up on my feet and joined her. This map has a different orientation than our own, Nataliya continued. See? It has the same continents, but Asia is much closer to the center. Goes to show how subjective our worldview is, doesnt it?

There doesnt seem to be any borders, I added.

Except this giant one separating Europe from Asia, added Nataliya.

And whats the meaning of these? I asked, pointing at pictograms of skulls that dotted the map. Some kind of dead zones?

Or something completely different. Nataliya pulled away some of her hair from her face and pointed at central Europe. Look, the skulls are different here. My God& I think those are the skulls of Neanderthals. And& She dragged her finger across the continents. I cant see any skulls resembling our own. She looked up at me. Oleksandr, I dont think our species even exist in this world. Its just as if we never evolved here or went extinct before we could get our footing right.

Enough of this! yelled the pilot who had grown frustrated with our conversation. This is some kind of trick, some kind of psychological warfare that you learned from the Americans.

Whats your name? I asked, speaking Russian.

Boris, he said. What is it to you, huh?

Boris, Nataliya pleaded. This isnt a trick. You saw those mammoths, the cave lions. How in the hell would anyone be able to *fake* that? Oleksandr and I were investigating strange radio signals coming from the cave. We already knew something strange was going on here, although we couldnt have guessed that thisa parallel *universe*was the answer.

Boris bit his nails. Im not supposed to be here. I was on my last mission before I was supposed to retire. My family is waiting for me back home.

Many people dont have families to go home to any more thanks to you and your friends, I said. You tried to murder us, two civilians!

Lets not argue about that, said Nataliya. We need to work together if we want to get out of here safely.

I wasnt going to kill you, Boris said. Im not a killer. I was merely trying to stop you.

Oh, come on, I said. You were literarily flying a death machine!

Im a soldier! Boris yelled. I was just following orders. Politics doesnt interest me. But there are always two sides to every conflict.

Yes, I said, and sometimes one of the sides is a fascist war criminal who commits atrocities against innocent civilians!

Boris looked down, his face showing a mix of shame and anger. I know. Ive seen it happen. But what choice did I have? Refusing to follow orders would have meant risking my life and my familys. And what good would that have done? Theres no justice in war.

Maybe not, I said. But that doesnt mean we should give up on trying to do whats right. We cant let those in power get away with their crimes. Do you really think Putin cares about your people? Hes the epitome of an evil dictator! Your country couldve been great, Boris, but instead, you live

I said I dont care about politics! Boris interrupted. I care about my *family*, about providing for my wife and daughter.

We need to put all of that behind us now, said Nataliya. Weve stumbled upon the greatest discovery ever made, something that changes our understanding of reality completely. This is bigger than any of our grievances& bigger than ourselves. Dont you see?

Youre right, I said. Any idea why theyre keeping us here?

This isnt a jail cell, Nataliya said. Its just an office. My guess is that theyre as surprised by us as were by them. We look more similar to Neanderthals than we look to them, especially you Oleksandr& No offense.

None taken, I said a bit grumpily. By all means, continue.

Still, she said, our faces are distinct, and combined with our clothes I dont think theyll confuse us with Neanderthals. They know we dont belong here, and theyre probably trying to figure out what to do with us.

Just then, the door opened again, and the woman walked in, accompanied by two guards. She spoke to us in her language and gestured for us to follow them. We were brought outside where a large, armored vehicle awaited us. It was unlike anything we had seen before, painted white and adorned with beautiful patterns.

Two armed men opened the back doors to the vehicle. The woman gestured for us to enter, and we complied, not wanting to anger our captors. The interior smelled of gasoline and metal, and we were jolted as the vehicle started moving. I stood up and looked out of the tiny windows at the back, but only saw the everlasting snow.

\*\*\*

They brought us to a massive complex, hidden away in the middle of nowhere. The building was enormous, made of concrete and steel, and surrounded by high walls topped with barbed wire. All were painted white, which made it almost impossible to see against the snow. The guards led us inside, down long corridors and through heavy metal doors.

Finally, we arrived at an empty room with a couple of beds in it and a large observation window on the wall. A man could be seen behind it, wearing a green turban just like the others and a decorated uniform of some kind. The guards left us and closed the door behind them, locking it with a loud clank.

Boris quickly ran up to the observation window and began yelling, again seemingly without realizing that they couldnt understand him. More people arrived behind the window to look at him, almost as if they found him entertaining.

Sit down! Nataliya said. I cant hear my own thoughts.

Boris quieted down, fell down with his back against the wall, and began to cry while mumbling something about his wife.

This doesnt look good, Nataliya, I said. What do they want with us?

It all depends on what they know about our species, she said. If my suspicion is correct and Homo sapiens went extinct here, they would be very interested in studying us. They also got my phone earlier, and it will probably make us look more alien to them than our faces.

Their technology seems to be a bit behind ours, I said. But their culture is remarkable, their art& Just look at their architecture! These people are no less than us, thats for sure. I wonder what the Neanderthals are like.

Will they ever let us out of here? Boris cried. I need to go home& I need to see my wife and daughter!

I felt a pinch of empathy for him, but not much more.

Unfortunately, I dont think theyll let us go, I said. Would your government have released a captured member of another species from a parallel universe? I laughed bitterly at the thought of it. No, theyll keep us here and study us like

Theres still hope, Nataliya said. What theyll want to know most of all is where we come from. This gives us the upper hand to a degree. We can try to communicate that well show them the cave, and once they take us there, I dont know, maybe we can make a run for it or something.

They wouldnt bring all of us there, I said. That would be foolish. I say we keep the cave a secret. We dont want them to know about our world, do we?

A woman behind the observation window spoke from a speaker, and then two guards entered the room and took Boris with them. He struggled but to no avail. I thought they would interrogate him and bring him back, but after several hours had passed, I realized that they had probably just taken him somewhere else, perhaps because he was injured, or maybe because he was dressed like a soldier, unlike me and Nataliya.

After what felt like forever, they finally brought me and Nataliya to another room. There were two women there, dressed in what looked like green hijabs and white surgical masks. The guards never left, holding their fingers close to their triggers. The women placed us in front of what looked like an old camera on a tripod and began taking pictures of us. We were then instructed to undress, which made us both feel uncomfortable and violated. We hesitated, but the guards made it clear that it wasnt a request.

Once we were in our undergarments, the women began examining us closely, taking notes and measurements. I felt like a lab rat and cringed at the thought of being just that for the rest of my life. Two large syringes were brought forth on a metallic tray, which they used to draw our blood. After about an hour, they handed us some clothes, simple robes made of rough fabric that scratched our skin, and then they brought us to yet another room where they forced us to sit down in front of another man in a green turban. He said a few words to us but seemed aware of the fact that we couldnt understand him.

Nataliya, I said and pointed at her and then I pointed at myself and said my own name.

He smiled and then pointed at himself and said something that sounded like Yidu. Next, he put a small map of the region on the tablesomething I only understood because I recognized the Zbruch Riverand nodded toward it, seemingly asking us to show him where we came from.

Should we tell him? asked Nataliya. Maybe its

The entire building shook, and the vague sound of an explosion could be heard from above. Yidu looked up, concerned, and then shouted something at the guards. Another explosion could be heard, and then a strangely melodic alarm began blaring throughout the building. The guards forced us up on our feet and ushered us out of the room. Nataliya, who was the last person to leave the room, quickly grabbed the map on the table without anyone noticing in the confusion and hid it behind her back. We were led toward the cell they had kept us in. People were running in every direction, shouting and screaming while the deafening, strange tune sounded over our heads on repeatfilling the air with its haunting melody. For every explosion above ground, the lights flickered, and dust fell from the ceiling. Then, a gunshot echoed through the chaos, and one of the guards fell to the ground. The other guard fired his rifle but was shot in the leg before he could reload. Boris, holding one of their rifles, stood in front of us. They had shaved his head, and there was a large wound on his cheek.

Boris! Nataliya said. Whats happening?

Theyre under attack, he said. I managed to overpower my guard in the commotion and took his gun.

This is our chance! I said. We need to find a way out of here!

Boris nodded, and we quickly followed him as he led us through the maze of corridors and rooms. The sound of gunfire and explosions echoed through the halls as we stumbled our way forward. We passed by rooms filled with equipment and supplies, but we didnt stop to investigate. Our only focus was finding a way out of this hellish place.

As we turned a corner, we were faced with a group of armed guards. They immediately opened firealmost as if they thought we belonged to whatever enemy was attacking themand we were forced to take cover behind a nearby metal cabinet. Boris returned fire, taking out one of the guards, but we were outnumbered and outgunned.

We need to find another way! Nataliya shouted over the noise.

Boris looked around and spotted a ventilation shaft above us. That way! he yelled, pointing upward.

We quickly climbed onto the cabinet and reached for the opening, pulling ourselves up into the shaft. It was cramped and dusty, but it offered a way out. We crawled as quickly as we could, the sounds of the chaos below us growing quieter as we moved farther away.

Finally, after what felt like forever, we saw a dim light up ahead. We hurried toward it and found ourselves at the exit of the ventilation system. Boris pushed open the grate and we climbed out into a deserted hallway. It was eerily quiet, even though we could still hear the distant sounds of the alarm and gunfire.

There must be an exit here somewhere, I said, and we started to move toward some stairs that seem to lead to the ground level. As we climbed, we could see signs of the attack all around uscracks in the walls, shattered glass, and the occasional dead body.

Finally, we burst through the door to the outside and were met with cold winds whipping our faces. It was the middle of the night now. The alarm echoed through the darkness. Above us, three black airships hovered with spotlights pointed at the ground, and a convoy of black, cumbersome tanks rolled past us. We crouched behind a nearby wall, trying to avoid detection. The tanks were unlike anything we had seen here so far, and the commanders wore dark uniforms and black metal helmets, unlike the Denisovan we had encountered before.

My God, Nataliya said. Neanderthals!

A bright light shone on us, and we froze. A group of Neanderthal soldiers had spotted us, and they were pointing their rifles at us. We slowly raised our hands, unsure of what to do next. But then, one of the soldiers was hit by a bullet, and he fell to the ground. We turned to see a group of Denisovans, taking cover behind a burnt-out vehicle while firing at the Neanderthals, and we managed to get away through the turmoil that followed.

How are we supposed to find our way back to the cave? I asked while we plodded through the snow to get as far away from the compound as possible.

I got the map, she said. I can use celestial navigation and

Thats not what I meant! I said. We wont get far in these old rags they forced us into until we freeze to death!

Nataliya stopped. What are you suggesting?

We need to sneak our way back and steal one of their trucks, I said. I mean, its the only way well make it out of here alive.

Nataliya hesitated, but then nodded in agreement. Okay, lets do it. But we need to be careful and stay out of sight.

Boris looked unhappy about it, but even he realized that walking through the blizzard was a death sentence.

We made our way back to the compound, keeping low and avoiding any of the soldiers. We searched for a vehicle that was still in good condition and could get us out of there fast. After several failed attemptsmostly because most of them were lockedwe finally found a large vehicle with tracks and a snowplow that seemed to be in decent shape and that wasnt locked.

Boris quickly got in the drivers seat and started to fiddle with the controls, but the vehicle wouldnt budge.

Do you think you can drive this thing? Nataliya asked as we sat down next to him.

I can drive anything, he grumbled, but his attempts to get the engine going were futile.

We need to get out of here now! I urged as the sound of approaching soldiers grew louder.

Finally, after several nerve-wracking minutes, the engine roared to life, and Boris grinned triumphantly. However, as he started to drive away, a shot rang out, and he slumped over in his seat, a bullet lodged in his belly. I screamed in terror, but Boris somehow managed to keep the vehicle moving.

Another vehicle pursued us, its headlights shining on us like a spotlight. We swerved and skidded over the icy terrain as we careened around corners and dodged obstacles in our path. The Denisovans in the pursuing vehicle fired at us, and we could hear the bullets whizzing past us.

Nataliya took Boriss rifle and did her best to return fire leaning out of the window, but her aim was shaky, and we didnt have much ammunition left. Boris was fading fast, but he gritted his teeth and kept driving, his blood staining the seat beneath him. Nataliya gave me the rifle and tried to help Boris by applying pressure to his wound, all while she also tried to keep her eye on the map in her lap.

Stay with us, she said, her voice shaking.

Boris groaned in response, but he didnt give up. His driving was erratic, and the vehicle was getting more difficult to control as we sped through the blizzard. I could see the panic in his eyes as he struggled to keep us on course.

I turned around and smashed the back window of the vehicle and pointed the rifle behind us, hoping to deter our pursuers. The Denisovans continued to fire at us, and I fired back, the recoil making my arms ache. I was a terrible shot, I always had been, and it felt as if I wasnt aiming at all, but after a few shots, I saw the driver in the pursuing vehicle slump over, and the vehicle swerved off course and crashed into a snowdrift.

I did it! I shouted, turning back to Boris and Nataliya. But my triumph was short-lived as I saw Boriss eyes slowly close, and his breathing becoming shallower.

Boris, no! Nataliya yelled. Stay awake, dont let go!

Panic rose within me as I realized we might not be able to make it without him, seeing how difficult the vehicle was to operate. Then, I saw a faint glimmer in the distance. It was a lantern attached to the top of the radio tower. We were close.

Were almost there! I said, pointing toward the light. Just hold on a little longer, Boris.

When we reached the hillside, Boris fell into Nataliyas lap with his pallid face turned up toward us. He was crying now, tears streaming down his face as he struggled to speak.

My family, he whispered, his voice barely audible. Tell them I love them. Tell my wife and daughter... Helena, tell her I wished Helena, Helena&

His words trailed off as he gasped for breath, and then he was gone. We dragged him out of the vehicle, and even though the night was freezing and the storm raged on around us, we decided to bury him under some snow and rocks. It was ironic, I thought, that a man who had once terrorized Ukrainian civilians were now being buried by two of them. But in his final moments, Boris had shown bravery and sacrifice that he deserved recognition for, even though it didnt undo the harm he had caused in the past.

As we made our way back to the cave, which was a struggle against the elements which took hours, I couldnt help but reflect on the complexities of war and the toll it takes on everyone involved. Boris had been a soldier, following orders and fighting for his country, but in the end, he had died a hero for two strangers from the very country he had fought against. And I thought about this other world, about the Denisovans and Neanderthals, and how they seemed to be caught up in the same cycles of senseless violence as Homo sapiens. Sadness gripped me thinking how universal it was, the propensity for violence and conflict& for war.

Back on our side, we covered up the hole that led to the other world with large rocks to stop anyone from that alternate Earth to venture onto ours. We then sent an anonymous letter to Boriss family, to let them know he didnt die a war criminal and that he loved them.

Ive returned to the cave with my receiver occasionally, just to confirm that what we went through really happened& that deep inside that hill, theres a cave to another world.

2023-02-12,1676225327,"Neighbor says I cant have chickens","I live in rural Washington on a lake. Ive been looking into getting quail and chickens, called the county to ask if I could and they gave me the clear. 

I live here full time in a one bedroom cabin that my great grandfather built in the 60s. Its one a 1/4 acre thats narrow and long. My neighbors visit their summer house maybe a month or so total out of the year. They bought it in 2017.

Im in the process of building my coop but dont have any birds yet. Its 10 from their house.

They came out for one night this weekend after being away for most the winter and come over to ask me if Im getting chickens and if Ive done my research. I say yes, as I literally did hours of research combing through the county website and found no regulations or ordinances for where I live. When I called the county they said there were no regulations outside the municipal head. His wife was like chickens poop a lot and we dont want it contaminating the lake and they go on to tell me that Im not allowed to have chickens or livestock according to some document so I ask for them to send it to me and close the door.

Yall this document is from 1956. Its a plot map of the whole lake and theres a part that states no poultry or livestock shall be kept or maintained on lots 1-217 abutting the waterfront. He must have pulled it from the university library archives cause the county doesnt even keep files from before 1970.

I know it says it quite clearly, but what the fuck? It probably refers to commercial or industrial operations, not just some person keeping a dozen birds. There werent any structures or houses built here yet in 1956. I know someone on the lake who had chickens last year and they didnt have any issues. The president of the POA told them there werent any regulations a couple years ago. Does a POA even have legal power over what I can do on my property?

Im still going to get my birds and get written confirmation from the county that Im allowed to have them. Im not even going to respond to this guy but I know Ill have issues with him in the future. So what to do? How to protect myself and my birds?

I want my neighbor to waste as much of his time as possible so Im not telling him shit about having permission from the county. Im feeling super petty cause these neighbors have been fucking with me and telling me what I can and cannot do since I moved out here full time two years ago and Im tired of it. So no eggs for you!! Im so done being nice.

Edit:

Woah this blew up thanks for all the input. I was worked up when I posted feeling like theyre picking on me but I definitely understand their concerns. I rarely see these folks and when I do, its brief and cordial. The guy treats me like a child and is sort of a creep but otherwise Im friendly but straightforward to them. 

About the coop: I made it aviary-style with native plants in it as part of my garden between my house and theirs. Its 15 from my place and is up against their property line, which is 10 from their north wall. Its a covered run that I planned on keeping quail in, not free range.

I have a quit claim deed. The OG deed is a little harder to get but Im working on it. The quit claim doesnt mention any of the covenants or ordinances or come with anything attached mentioning a POA. POA president has now seen the document and denies being asked or allowing the other property to have chickens. So thats all he-say. They got rid of them last year, but it still set a precedent I think. The POA dues are optional and they dont have final say what you can do on your property.

Ill go talk to the county and see if the document is still valid, and if so then Im shit out of luck for chickens! I can probably find a loophole for quail though. Try to hide them, but I definitely need a fence or better tree cover. Some municipalities dont consider cortunix quail as poultry so Ill check with mine.","homestead",390,"https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/110m3od/neighbor_says_i_cant_have_chickens/"

2023-03-03,1677852172,"Disciples of the Witness: A Cesspool of Broken Individuals","Hey people! Kinda my first ever time at writing and article about the game's lore, and I wanna talk about some interesting tendency I discovered, and wrote in the title:

Disciples are a collection of broken individuals made fanatical believers in the Witness's cause. 

#Case 1: Rhulk, son of Rhelik. 

Let's summarize Rhulk's past: he lived with his tribe and his father in the wildernesands, because long ago they chose not to bow to Traveler-blessed Regime, and it's tempting comfort, became Wanderers and as a result they were systematically hunted by packs of Stalkers. Rhelik, and soon his son Rhulk, inspired by the bloodshed his father wrought, fought off the Stalkers together. But because of Rhelik's brutality, he was shunned, much to Rhulk's disappointed. 

Rhulk relished in the kills, quickly becoming unusually cruel, and this state worsened a lot when he lost his father to the Regime. He was furious, and out of fury he skinned a on alien puppy alive. Later, he was exiled for the same cruelty his father had. He wandered the wilderness and killed many Stalkers, until he encountered Rhelik, dressed in Stalker uniform. He was in awe when he saw him as a servant to the Regime, hell, to *anyone*, and so Rhulk became a part of the Regime too. 

Very soon Rhulk was disgusted with his father, who became soft, who watched as the very people he was a part of being torn apart, despite his past oaths to take the Regime down. Later, Rhelik confessed to his son that he wasn't completely loyal to the Regime. Constant lies infuriated Rhulk, so he fought his father, who fled to the Wilderness, just to lure Rhulk to his clan and throw him to the Abyss. 

And that's where the Witness comes in and says ""I can fix him"". 

Empowering Rhulk and fueling his rage they make him rise from the Abyss and kill everyone on the planet, and then the planet itself. 

&gt;""And what do you feel now? Devoid of family. Devoid of The Regime. Devoid of Lubrae. What do you feel here, in our embrace, now that they are gone and you are left? What do you feel, my child?""
&gt;""Relief.""

And so, the broken being, overwhelmed with pain, betrayed by his family, his clan, his planet, fueled by wrath, became a Disciple. Cruel, wrathful, but eternally grateful to the Witness for revealing the truth to him, helping him to relieve the pain. 

&gt;""We know pain. Our purpose... is it's end.""

 The Witness to Calus. 

#Case 2: Emperor Calus. 

We all know Calus. The merry-go round fella, who overthrew the corrupt oligarchy of the Praetorate and became the Emperor, the ever-celebrating and joyful. He enacted the Golden Age of the Cabal Empire without the Traveler, made whole knowledge-vault worlds, granted citizen status to the Legionnaires. But not everyone was pleased by his reign: his Evocate-General, his Dominus, his chief of bodyguards, his main celebration organizer, and finally, his daughter Caiatl, arranged a coup. 

He was sentenced to exile on a pleasure barge, Leviathan, with coordinates set to the edge of nowhere. In this travel Calus almost gone mad from the sadness and despair. Why didn't they like his celebrations? Why the Cabal must always return to militarism? Why can't they just *have fun*?

And then the Leviathan stopped at the edge of nowhere. 

And then, Calus witnessed. 

He found his new purpose. He now wanted to be the Herald of the coming end. And so it began: the assembly of the Shadows, the vengeance on the ones who arranged the coup. Coming to Sol in an attempt to sway the Guardians. The communion aboard Glykon Volatus, and transformation of the Leviathan in preparation to merge Calus's consciousness with the Pyramid. He wanted to relish the title of the Emperor again, to prove to everyone that he still can have fun, he still is Cabal, mainly prove this point to himself. 

And so, a crestfallen Emperor who relished in celebration  and lavish lifestyle, betrayed by those who he loved with all his heart, who found his new purpose by gazing into the darkness, endured when it gazed back, became a Disciple, renewed and reinvigorated, ever-grateful to the Witness. 

Which answers a question that probably troubled many people when Bungie introduced Rhulk and Disciplehood as a concept:

#Why Oryx or his sisters didn't become Disciples?

Aside from awfully rational answer ""Because in the times of The Taken King there was no Witness"" I have a little bit  more... interesting one. 

&gt; Puppets, all of them. Every last Krill. Every last Hive. I once believed in a higher calling as they do. But you know that. You rescued me from that. **Eternal appreciation** doesn't even scratch the surface of what I owe you for the gifts you gave me. I know you hoped the Krill would see it too. We tried. We really did. But we had to let them struggle& All because of a **belief that purpose had finally found them**. Given them strength to conquer an oppressive homeworld. How else were they to grow? 

Eh? Get it? Rhulk talks down to the Hive as if they were nothing but Witness's private army, but he completely misses the point:

#Rhulk and Calus have a purpose because of the Witness.

The Osmium Court, however, has a purpose because they had one from the beginning: overpower a hostile homeworld, conquer their enemies. And in symbiosis with the worms they fulfilled their wishes, escaped the Fundament, and then understood that their purpose is much greater. That's how Oryx interprets the Final Shape: 

&gt; The only way to make something good is to make something that can't be broken. And the only way to do that is to try to break everything. I'm glad I learned that the universe runs on death. It's more beautiful to know.

 Books of Sorrow, XXXIV  More beautiful to know

Osmium Court found their own purpose themselves, without Witness's help. They themselves endured and overcame the hardships that stood before them. To put it simply - they are too gigachad to be Disciples. That's basically it. 

TL;DR: The Witness collects broken, desperate, mad beings, gives them purpose, and in return he has powerful zealots that do his bidding. And the Osmium Court are too autonomous, successful, and overall gigachads to be Disciples.

2023-03-01,1677636242,"NAIT is threatening to remove 95% of an entire faculties resources by selling off the desktop computers that Technology students need. Tuition prices stay the exact same.","At a bit of a loss here, a lot of the students are going to struggle with this decision, I hope by spreading awareness of the severity of this type of policy we can reverse it. If this goes through, I have a feeling other institutions will follow in NAIT's footsteps.

On January 6th, 2023, students of the Digital Media and IT (DMIT)  program at NAIT received  an email from the Program Chair about a **significant** change called the ""Bring Your Own Device"" program.

The Bring Your Own Device program states that in the fall of 2023, all current lab computers will be removed. All DMIT students, new and continuing, will be required to purchase a suitable laptop for use  at NAIT in the fall of 2023.

On NAIT's website, their *Domestic Students Tuition and Fees* breakdown  states that students pay on average $8,940 CAD/year for tuition and  school fees. For international students, that cost increases to  $26,340-$36,040 CAD/year. By implementing the BYOD program, NAIT is  asking their current and future students to tack on an additional  $1,500-$3,500 CAD for purchasing their own personal laptop. 

Here are the hardware requirements needed for System Administration:

&amp;#x200B;

* Windows 10 64bit or newer
* Intel 8th Gen, core i7 or greater
* 32 GB of Ram or greater
* 512GB SSD (1TB recommended)
* Onboard video or greater
* 1920x1080 Display
* Wi-Fi 5 or Wi-Fi 6
* 720p Webcam or greater with microphone
* 1TB or greater External Hard Drive

With a simple google search, based on these system requirements, a new HP laptop with the **MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS** sells  for $3,329.00 USD. That is $4,546.57 CAD, which you may notice, is  $1,000 above what they claim is the maximum students will have to spend  on laptops.

Currently, students in this program have Desktop PC's provided by the  college which meets all minimum requirements, they also have two  monitors to work with. We are able to work on all assignments, labs,  quizzes, and most importantly our capstone projects in the classrooms at  the school. By taking these away, students' loss of resources cannot be  described as anything less than monumental.

If we allow organizations like NAIT to implement policies and programs like this, other faculties can and will follow in their footsteps. Colleges and Universities can cut costs of their resources  that they provide while they keep tuition prices the same. Students looking to apply to programs like this will feel less inclined to apply to a program that costs twice as much in tuition as other programs at NAIT. Current students will feel more stress and pressure than ever to find, purchase and use these devices that NAIT is suggesting we buy. 

Edit -  Okay, lets try this analogy. Imagine if NAIT took away and sold all of  the culinary students ovens and told them they all had to bring their  own toaster ovens. That is what is happening to DMIT students right now.  They're taking our damn ovens people!","Edmonton",339,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/11er415/nait_is_threatening_to_remove_95_of_an_entire/"

We believe that because porn shows us sexual content, that's it's close to the act of sex. This is why we (hopefully used to) believe that porn is normal. Sex is healthy and normal, porn is just sex, so porn is healthy and normal. Right?

The scientific evidence already shows us that  on a purely chemical level  the brain reacts the exact same way to porn as it does to drugs. There are only two things in the world that make our brain react in this exact way. Porn and drugs. That's it. 

Porn is also used  in the same way as drugs  to change our state of mind. We use it when we're unhappy, lonely, sad, bored, or even horny, to make ourselves even more turned on. To make ourselves feel happy, like we're connecting with someone. To make us forget our problems for a while. To make ourselves feel excited. It's the exact same escape that drugs provide.

Certain drugs enhance sexual desire, such as cocaine and MDMA, and yet doing a line of coke before masturbating seems crazy. Both porn and coke are addictive, both have been proven to cause physical and mental problems from overuse, yet one is universally accepted and one is universally condemned. If someone told you that they often do coke because it makes masturbation better, you'd be worried for them, and yet millions of people do the same thing with porn and (almost) no one ever questions it.

Porn is not sex. Porn will never be sex. Porn is about altering your mind and flooding it with dopamine. In fact, porn could be describe as the complete opposite of sex. It kills our natural urge to go out into the world and look for sex. In many cases, if you do find yourself in a sexual situation, porn often creates enough problems that it prohibits you from performing sexually. 

A wiser man than me once wrote: ""Masturbating to porn to prepare for sex is like playing golf for years to compete at Wimbledon. Its training for the wrong sport.""

Don't let porn trick you into thinking it's something it's not. When you know what you're battling against, it makes the fight a lot easier win and a lot easier to understand.

Let's begin, just so you all know, some of you may get mad at what I'm going to say. But it's the truth without any sugarcoating because I want to see everyone succeed.

If you had your desire, you would not be lurking on here constantly.

If you had your desire, you would not be religiously watching manifesting videos, constantly taking in the content, constantly rereading the same success stories over and over. You would just live your life. THAT'S THE TRUTH. 

Here's an example of how I saw this play out for myself:

In my first year of university, I had feelings for a friend of mine. I made it my mission to manifest her. I read every word Neville has ever written and spoken. I took notes, combed through every YouTuber, and read every post on here. I never got her. I never got that woman. In fact, I never even realized that the excessive consumption and overanalyzation of this law is in itself a state of lack. You are constantly trying to re-feed your starving mind, reminders that this law works, and how it works. 

If you go through success stories of people who actually did an amazing job at bringing their desires into fruition, a lot of them took a break from reddit. 

Now, in contrast to my example, I have another one. Last year, there was a coworker of mine that I had found very attractive. At this point, I stopped reading Neville for months and stayed away from this sub because I didn't really have a burning desire for anything. This time, I remembered what I did wrong before and chose to continue to stay away from all things related to reassuring myself that the law exists, instead I used my desire coming into fruition as my reassurance.

I sat in bed the night I realized I was attracted to her, and I spoke out loud, ""This is my turn to test all that I have learned over the past few years. I will show myself my own power.""

As a result, I never looked at Reddit or did any reading or looked for any reassurance or discussion. I simply just assumed it to be true. I fell asleep every night imagining scenarios that showed her love for me. The only thing I did was listen to Edward Art's videos every couple nights, simply because I loved his content and his way of speaking - not to help me with my desire.

Within 2 weeks, that woman was head over heels for me. Despite my 3D showing me that she was hesitant, uninterested, and oblivious, against all odds - without lifting a finger - she fell in love with me.

Everything I have ever manifested, from a car, to a place to live, three amazing jobs, social life, women, money, family, health, beauty, weight loss - I GOT IT ALL WHEN I STOPPED OBSESSING OVER THIS. 

You have read it all, you know it all. Why do you keep coming back to feed your hunger? Your hunger should be fed by your assumption and imagination, not by living through other people's reassurance and success stories. 

Now, I live my dream life, and I have returned to posting sporadically and responding to messages because I want to support people the way I was supported in my state of desperation. 

I hope this makes sense to you all, lots of love to everyone who reads this and is trying to make the best out of their lives.","NevilleGoddard",107,"https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/11cqk0e/the_truth_about_your_desperation/"
2023-02-22,1677083217,"1983 murder of Christina Castiglione - SOLVED","The Livingston County Sheriff's Department has announced the resolution of the cold case homicide of 19 year old Christina Castiglione.

Christina lived in Redford Township at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on March 19, 1983, walking westbound on 5 Mile Road near Lola Park in Redford Township.

Her body was found 10 days later, on March 29, 1983, on state-owned land near the intersection of Fisher and Faussett roads. Her body was found after a heavy snowfall and the start of the snow melting.

Charles David Shaw has been identified has her murderer. Shaw lived about 5 miles from where she vanished near Livonia (Michigan). Shaw died in November of 1983 - he died of autoerotic asphyxia. His widow is still alive and provided a lot of information to LE about his behavior in the months leading up to and after the murder.

[Season of Justice](https://seasonofjustice.org/) provided funding for the DNA analysis which lead to the discovery of her killer.  


There was no known relationship between Christina and Shaw. 

I don't know if her parents are still around, but her sister attended today's press conference.

""I'm not detecting any deviation sir.""

""Give them some time.""

Ten seconds passed.

""Nothing sir.""

""Fire a warning shot.""

The vessel stopped with impossible swiftness; a second later, it seemingly blinked out of existence.

""What the hell was that?""

Target lock warnings began to blare within the station.

""Get me a lock on that ship now!""

The ship re-entered reality only 1 millimeter from the dura-glass window of the outpost, roughly 3 meters wide, a meter tall. With brutal and angular wings protruding from a perfectly spherical metal core. On the front side of this orb, a single beady red sensor shone brightly, scanning the station and everyone in it. The back side of the orb was defined by a protruding engine that let off an incredibly bright white glow.

Station master Lar fell off his chair in terror; communications officer Wot fainted at once, and weapons handler Yul simply stared in astonishment.

The ship knew all of this, concluding its scan in a fraction of a millisecond, pausing a few seconds to ensure nothing was missed and blinked out of reality once more.

""Yul, man Wot's station at once! Hail the fleet!""

Wot rushed to the emergency hail button that sat front and center on the communications panel. Out of the corner of his fourth eye, he saw the unknown vessel blink back into reality, this time substantially further away. Only the dull red glow of the orb's sensor could be seen. Slamming his claws down upon the emergency button, Wot didn't even have time to process what occurred next.

Sensing the transmission for help being sent, the orb momentarily outshone every star in the galaxy; sending a beam of energy toward the station. The red light emanating from the orb returned only half a second later. But the station and its crew could no longer see it; within that half-second burst, the orb had completely deleted everything within 100 meters of the station. For the first time in this universe's history, a point in space reached the ever illusive absolute zero.

After blinking in and out of reality one more time, the ship returned to its original course, a straight shot to the planet Zipta, the capital world of the Toran Republic.

Two hundred light seconds from the unknown vessel and closing fast were the Ziptan Outer perimeter fleet. Standing 1000 strong, this mighty armada fell under the control of Admiral Houl. Hardened by countless battles over the last 15 millennia, she took pride in her position as the first line of defense for her beloved republic's crown jewel. Her FTL sensors were detecting a small object, the unknown vessel, but she was made nervous by the lack of any station on even the most powerful of sensors.

Houl began to suspect a false alarm, wondering if some glitch in the system had confused this empty pocket of space for a station under attack; she was brought back to reality alongside the rest of her fleet only seconds later.

*""Pesh, status report!""*

First officer Pesh massaged his forehead, fighting through the pain, he gave a response,

""*Whole fleet just got knocked out of FTL, pulling up visual on the unknown vessel now.*""

The bridge of Houl's flagship, the *Ironclad*, went completely silent. This little orb with angular wings melded into its form had somehow ripped through space and time, pulling an entire battlefleet out of warp space, and it just sat there. The dim red glow of its sensors made Houl nervous; it was watching them, scanning for weaknesses, or maybe threats.

""*Try to hail it, charge up the spinal mount, tell the fleet to pull back to a distance of at least 1 lightsecond.*""

""*Yes mamn.*""

Houl studied the curious vessel, then came to a shocking realization,

""*We're not moving...*""

""*Mamn?*""

""*We're stationary in comparison to all other frames of reference...*""

""*That's not possible, gravity alway-*""

""*See?*""

Houl quickly scanned the nav map in front of her,

""*Did the fleet receive the order to move?*""

She didn't need the answer to that question because she had already come to terms with reality,

""*That... Thing... It's holding us in place!*""

""*Orders mamn?*""

Houl glanced around the bridge. Every sensor output the same result, originally, this thing was headed toward Zipta. She couldn't let it achieve its goal.

""*All ships, fire at will!*""

The familiar booming of gunfire filled Houl's ears, and the recoil of the cannons reverberated through her body. Under normal circumstances, she'd feel relieved; these were no normal circumstances. Her paws gripped her chair tightly. After 30 seconds of constant bombardment, she relaxed enough to give the order,

""*All ships, Cease fire!*""

Houl glared at the screen in front of her, waiting for the dust to clear in the area where this vessel was last seen. She didn't risk blinking for fear of missing it, she nearly passed out from holding her breath so long, but eventually, the smoke began to clear. She exhaled deeply, closing her eyes and trying to relax. When she opened her eyes, it was as if shed been punched squarely on the jaw,

""*Fire at will! Throw everything you've got at it!*""

The damn thing was still there! Thirty seconds of bombardment from an entire fleet and the damn thing didn't so much as get scratched!

""*Captains are reporting in, movement systems restored!*""

""*Aim the spinal mount, hit this bastard hard!*""

Just before the weapon could fire, the little ship disappeared, reemerging milliseconds later some 10 light seconds away. The beady red orb began to glow brightly once more, turning a pure and blinding white; at least, that's what was shown on visuals some 10 seconds after it was already well on its way. The sensors saw it coming from the beginning, 10 seconds before Houl and her fleet were turned to cinders, every single FTL sensor array within the thousand-strong armada overloaded and crashed. The stalwart defenders of Zipta were no more.

Tired of attempting to slowly and non-confrontationally approach the capital world, the orb simply jumped within visual range of Zipta and waited for high command to remember to send it the translated language of these aliens. The ship's artificial consciousness had grown quite tired of these aliens constantly charging weapons and shooting at it; it hadn't done anything but travel in a straight line for crying out loud!

After zipping around the planet a couple of times to scan its surroundings, the ship was displeased to learn that well over a hundred thousand guns had already been trained on it; thinking to itself *those damn aliens never learn.* It simply spooled up its interdimensional energy link and let slip the dogs of war one last time, erasing every weapon within a light year to ensure no more hostilities could take place from now on.

After surveying its surroundings; jumping from viewport to viewport to find humor in the shocked expressions of military vessel captains who could no longer find their sidearms at their hip; or even the main guns of their ships. The orbs creators had told it to stop finding humor in others' discomfort, the ship had tried, but these others were just so damn annoying that the orb stopped listening.

One alien ship of massive size attempted to ram the orb, they succeeded but came to an immediate stop upon collision. The comparatively tiny ship simply remained still, its red eye glowing in amusement at these aliens' attempts to assail it. *They certainly were determined,* it thought.

In one last final act of spite, the ship decided to blink into existence *inside* one of these now-disarmed ships, right behind its captain. The look of terror on the captain's face as he slowly turned his chair around to face the ship's eye was priceless. Even more humorous was the detection of biological waste leaking from the captain. The orb blinked away in hysterics, and the captain of that alien ship was left with soiled pants and considerable embarrassment.

Tired of waiting for command, the ship decided to warp directly in front of the president of this alien republic below it. The president fell down, obviously not expecting a floating orb with wings to pop into existence within his secret and secure underground bunker. The ship's red eye focused on the president for a moment. It could sense the alien's heart rate was erratic. *Poor thing,* it thought, *if only his underlings had been more cooperative*...

One of the president's guards threw something at the ship.

*THAT'S IT, THESE DAMN ALIENS KEEP HITTING ME!!!*

The ship turned instantaneously to face the guard, charging up its capacitors with enough force to remove this whole damned universe! *Those pesky little aliens are going to pay! No more abuse! No more conflict!* ***NO MORE UNIVER***\*-\*

**SWOOSH**

President Poplu stared in horror as another being materialized in his bunker. This time it was a bipedal and decidedly organic being. It had materialized directly in front of the red eye that had begun to glow brightly white; after a few seconds of an incredibly tense staredown, the orb's eye returned to the dull red color it had been previously. After pushing a few buttons on his wrist, the biped spoke,

""Return home construct.""

With the exchange finished, the orb dematerialized, disappearing just as quickly as it had appeared in the first place.

President Poplu pinched himself,

""*Am I dreaming?*""

The biped turned around. It was at this moment that Poplu noticed it was levitating. Cloaked in a mix of gray and bright white, the biped before him exuded a sense of power; no, it seemed to radiate energy with its mere presence. Where Poplu presumed eyes would normally be located only searing white energy could be found, Poplu had to shield his eyes to avoid squinting.

""No, you are not.""

The being reached out a hand with incredible grace. Poplu took it and pulled himself up to his feet,

""*Who are you?*""

""I am Frederick Torvus, current High Councilor of the Greater Realm of Humankind. You must be President Poplu of the Toran Republic?""

Now it was Poplu's turn to extend his hand,

""*Yes I am, I hate to be so direct, but what exactly was that thing?*""

The human shook Poplu's hand firmly while responding,

""A malfunctioning human probe, it was on its way to inform you of the good news.""

""*That news being?*""

""Your universe will not be harvested for energy.""

Poplu went quiet for a moment. The human now decided to elaborate,

""Human technology uses the power of entire universes to function properly, we have what is an essentially infinite number of probes cataloging universes to see which ones do or don't contain life.""

Poplu was having a hard time comprehending what this human was saying, a nearby science advisor, however, was practically foaming at the mouth to know more. A nearby admiral addressed a more pressing concern,

""Do these probes normally demilitarize an entire race?""

The human's face softened,

""I'm sorry to say that it did more than demilitarize you, at least 124,375 of your servicemen have perished at the hand of the probe,"" the human put up a hand as if to silence any discourse that may have otherwise boiled over, ""They will be brought back, and the council has already decided upon a reparation of 1 universal unit to ensure our people end on the right footing.""

The nearby science advisor couldn't contain her excitement and demanded to know,

""Is a universal unit, well...""

The human knew exactly what she was asking and answered with a grin,

""Yes, the entire energy content of one universe, no strings attached.""

The science advisor had to sit down to avoid fainting,

""Humanity will also provide several scientists to show you how to operate such technology, as well as unlimited access to the Human knowledge database for a period of 10 years. All of our technology, it will be available to you.""

The science officer fell out of the chair; her entire body had gone weak at the prospect of accessing a nigh-omniscient repository of knowledge.

The human took one last look around the room,

""Are these terms acceptable?""

Poplu, propping himself up with the help of a nearby table, could only respond in one way,

""Y-Y-Yes! Yes that is acceptable!""

With that, the human smiled, snapped his fingers, and vanished from view.

An outpost class station, Yul, Wot, and Lar, came back into being. None of them could quite remember what exactly had occurred just minutes previous and went back to lazily sweeping their sector.

A thousand-strong armada popped back into existence. Admiral Houl complained of a splitting headache and took an acetaminophen painkiller, and returned to her watchful scouring for emergency beacons.

The weapons in holsters across the system re-materialized, as did any other weapon the malfunctioning probe had removed in its fit of rage.

Several pairs of pants were reverted to a state of cleanliness, and all recollection of them being anything but clean had been removed from the mind of any admiral, officer, or recruit alike.

Scientists across the entire republic flocked to Zipta to meet with human scientists and study their secrets.

A malfunctioning probe returned home to human space.

Part of a mystery that began when a mans remains were found in 1987 has been solved after police Monday announced they have been able to identify him. 

And with the way technology has advanced in recent years, the second part of the mystery  how [Robert Earl Sanders](https://wfmj.images.worldnow.com/images/24189206_G.jpeg?auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;height=560&amp;fit=bounds&amp;lastEditedDate=1677547964000), 22, of Parkwood Avenue, died, may be achievable someday.

This bounces all over the place, added Chief of Detectives Capt. Jason Simon. Cold cases are frequently solved by people giving us information and connections. This case is all about connections.

The bust that was unveiled at an August press conference, seeking help in identifying the set of bones found that were later determined to be Sanders at a cemetery in the Sharon Line neighborhood of the East Side, also helped police solve the fate of a Toledo man who went missing in 1981.

Sanders identity was announced Monday at a press conference at the Covelli Centre by city police, the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, and the Fayette County Sheriffs Office.

\-

Sanders was reported missing on Aug. 13, 1976, by his mother, who told police she had last seen her son on Aug. 9, 1976. The report added his mother told the officer it is not like him to leave.

A 71-year-old man and his grandson were hunting for squirrels on Sept. 10, 1987, at Liberty Road and Atkinson Avenue near [Mount Hope Cemetery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mt+Hope+Park+Cemetery,+Youngstown,+OH+44505/@41.1317359,-80.6433183,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8833ef3a1089fe8b:0x7e057b4510813aea!8m2!3d41.1266283!4d-80.6045904!16s%2Fg%2F11bvth0dbt) when they found a skull, reports said. Other bones included a clavicle, a scapula, and some teeth.

The bones were taken to the anthropology department at Youngstown State University to be examined further, but for some reason, that examination either never took place or any record of that examination is missing.

The bones remained there until a former anthropology student at YSU reached out to the police in August 2021 about the bones. The student told police she had thought of the bones over the years and was concerned because no one ever found out the identity of the person they belonged to.

With that phone call, a case that been cold for 34 years grew warm, Simon said.

That is when police called in BCI, who did a bust of the face based on the bones available and announced it at an Aug. 25 press conference at the police department. It didnt take long for police to get a tip on who the person may have been.

**Sweeney said a man called from Cincinnati and told police they had the wrong race for the bust. The man said the bust belonged to a white person and said the mans name was Theodore Long, 19, who went missing in 1981 from Toledo.**

Sweeney said the caller was wrong about the mans race  the bust represented a black man  but he listened to the callers story and in turn contacted Toledo police.

Between the two departments, they learned of [a man whose remains were fished out of a creek in Fayette County](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/images/341UMOH.jpg). The man was never identified, but investigators did have his fingerprints on file, where they stayed for years.

Sweeney was in contact with Toledo police while BCI consulted Columbus police. Toledo police used the fingerprints they had on file for Long, and they matched the corpse that was fished out of [the creek](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paint+Creek/@39.2764908,-83.3078674,8z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8847132dd213f2e7:0x363dd2f1a1f9026b!8m2!3d39.3978493!4d-83.1709406!16zL20vMGQwcnkx) in 1981.

But while investigators knew of Longs fate, they still did not know who the skull and other bones found on the East Side belonged to. Investigators sent the bones they had to Othram Labs in The Woodlands, Texas, to be tested. Othram specializes in getting molecular DNA from bones. They shared their findings with an Akron-based group that specializes in missing persons cases, the Porch Light Project, which helped pay for the testing with a grant.

With the DNA profile that was compiled, Porch Light was able to do a genealogical DNA search that led them to Sanders family. A family member then submitted a DNA sample when contacted, and that confirmed that the skull belonged to Sanders.

A cause of death for Sanders is officially listed as undetermined, but Sweeney said he was hopeful that someone can call with some information. Investigators may be able to learn how and even when he died. At the time he was found, investigators believed the skull had been there for three to five years

Identifying both men is crucial for investigators to try and figure out how Sanders and Long died, Yost said.

This is just the beginning. This is not the end, Yost said.

The woman who informed Sweeney about Sanders bones in the first place, Alisa Yelkin, also spoke. She said she first saw Sanders during a class when his skull was in what she termed a lost and found box.

I wondered who he was, I wondered what he looked like, she said.

Over the years, she spoke to police several times but they did not take her seriously, she said. But when she reached out to Sweeney after reading an article about his work in cold cases, she felt comfortable that he would work the case as best he could.

Fayette County Sheriff Vernon P. Stanforth said his agency has been trying to identify Long for years and he said he was very appreciative of Youngstowns help in the case. He said Longs death has been ruled a homicide.

We now have a name as our detectives work this homicide case, Stanforth said.

2023-02-15,1676441110,"Morocco, Coal, and the Muslim World; a quick overview of obvious errors by Paradox.","So, I want to preface this with, I love Vic3, I've got around 200 hours put into the game, and I'm absolutely going to put in many, many more. But I also have to say that I'm a little disappointed in the level of research that seems to have gone into this game, and the best case study I have found is Morocco.

&amp;#x200B;

Morocco starts in the mid-40s by Power Ranks, easily encroached upon by the closest European powers in Spain and France; even Portugal, should they so choose, can easily swipe some territory from you early on. And while Morocco is neither a massive country population-wise (like China, Sokoto, or Sikh) nor sitting on a mass of resources (like Brazil, Persia, or Sokoto), it should nevertheless be a fun and interesting nation to play, for a number of reasons; chiefly, its proximity to Europe. It's easy to get involved in European power politics when you're just on the other side of the narrowest part of the Mediterranean Sea. To add to this, Morocco has some serious mineral wealth; 60 Iron deposits, with more in West Sahara easily accessible should they win that Colonization race, 30 Lead deposits and 32 Sulfur deposits,  plenty to move into soft metal and arms production as well as Chemical Plants &amp; Munitions.

But there's one thing missing, and I'm sure you're all shouting about it right now; Coal. Well, in Vic 3 Morocco has none coal. Nada. Which is curious, because both in the Historical Record and in [Modern Sources](https://www.britannica.com/science/coal-fossil-fuel/World-distribution-of-coal) there are clearly deposits of coal in Morocco. Moreover, the Silver Mines in Inner Morocco were important enough to warrant inclusion in EU4, and are still productive today, but are conspicuously absent from Vic3.

Also conspicuously absent is any real recognition of Muslim &amp; Arab scholarship. Of the roughly 30 countries that run from Morocco in the west through the Middle East to Central Asia, which comprise the conquests &amp; former domains of the Caliphates &amp; Sultanates of the Islamic Golden age that ended the 1250s AD with the sack of Baghdad, only 4 Countries start with the Academia technology; the Ottomans, Egypt, Circassia, and the Caucasian Imamate. To put this into perspective, [Morocco's oldest University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_al-Qarawiyyin) was founded as a Mosque in the 9th century, and was spoken of as one of the greatest centers of Islamic scholarship and learning as early as the 1200s; in Samarkand, Bukhara, they built an Observatory to better understand the Astronomy of the night sky in the 1400s. But it is the Ottomans and the 2 tiny Sunni states that exist only as enclaves within the Russian Empire that are the most Technologically advanced.

In comparison, Moldavia starts the game with as good or better a technological position as the Ottomans. Moldavia, still one of the poorest regions of Europe, founded the first university in Romania in the 1860s, in Iasi, and modern Moldova has one of the lowest literacy rates in all of Europe. But they're European, so...

This clear and obvious lack of research is felt elsewhere in the game (Cierro Rico de Potosi, which has been the single most productive silver mine in the world for nearly 500 years doesn't have a province modifier?)  but in Morocco, it is all coalesced in a perfect storm; it doesn't have the correct resources, the starting tech is woefully misrepresented, and to top it all off, there are plenty of claims that Morocco not only does now, but always has, controlled Western Sahara, which Britain always colonizes right away in my games. They don't even have a claim to re-take the treaty port of Melilla from Spain; you have to eclipse them in Power Level to start a ""take Treaty Port"" play on them to reclaim a piece of one of your starting states! If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking with me, I hope you learned something, and maybe even have a pet peeve about a lack of research/resources/tech somewhere in the game that bothers you as much as this bothers me.

TLDR; PDX needs to do their research better on Resource Distribution &amp; technological starts, and Morocco is a perfect example of both issues.","victoria3",119,"https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/112r17w/morocco_coal_and_the_muslim_world_a_quick/"
2023-03-03,1677857864,"[Comic Books] Comic Book mutual funds and the man who helped fuel the Great Comics Crash of 1996","Before I get into the drama, MASSIVE shout-out to /u/Lorpedodontist, whose [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/10ks367/i_just_learned_about_kingpin_comics_a/) on r/comicbooks first brought this historical tidbit to my attention. Unfortunately, this drama is situated before comic forums became truly widespread, and much of it has been lost to time.

In 1996, the American comic book industry crashed. As [TV Tropes puts it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatComicsCrashOf1996), 1996 was the year ""when the dawning realization that things were about to go downhill started to hit the comic world."" This is something that had been coming for a long time, as the major comics publishers began to cater more and more to speculator markets and speculators began to invest heavily in publishers with star power, but not necessarily mainstream appeal. Some of the most egregiously pro-speculator things the major publishers did included [selling comics pre-bagged](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/460567-polybagged/), [selling multiple variant covers of single issues](https://www.cbr.com/bad-90s-comic-book-covers/#the-amazing-spider-man-400-1995), and [pushing gimmicky storylines with the intent of creating media hype](https://www.cbr.com/wonder-woman-90s-biker-costume/). Sometimes they did [all three at once](https://www.keycollectorcomics.com/variant/original/superman-2-75,31571/issues/)!

This was unsustainable, but could have been forgiven had speculators objectively evaluated the market. Being speculators, however, they did anything but. Looking at the steadily-increasing value of comic books like [Action Comics #1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Comics_1#Collectibility) (first appearance of Superman), they naively thought any comic could be the ""next big thing."" Speculators would buy multiple copies of the same book, even for standard issues or unoriginal storylines. They overlooked that Action Comics #1 and comics like it weren't valuable because they were old, they were valuable because they were ""key issues"" (Issues with significance to future story-lines or history) and because they were *rare*. Perhaps nothing is more indicative of this than [X-Force #1](https://gocollect.com/comic/x-force-1). [This book had a print run of up to 5,000,000 copies](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/384211-whats-up-with-x-force-1/?do=findComment&amp;comment=9961173). [It was sold in a plastic bag calling it a ""1st issue collector's item"" and came with a ""limited edition"" trading card](https://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/n_iv/600/676185.jpg). And despite the obvious pandering, people bought it up. One Redditor (/u/Adventurous_Lime1049) even [bought 100 copies of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookcollecting/comments/yg89rd/paper_or_plastic_debagged_or_bagged_forever_whats/iu9r0j8/), still in the bag, from a man named Greg Buls. It is this man who our story revolves around.

Greg Buls was a prominent comic dealer in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and when I say prominent, I mean it. Hes one of two people credited with discovering the [Circle 8 Pedigree Collection](https://www.cgccomics.com/resources/pedigree/circle-8/), a collection of 100,000 comic books discovered in a barn that contains many of the highest graded horror and science fiction comics from the 1950s. He [helped pioneer](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/483546-tomb-of-dracula-cgc-99-on-comiclink-auction/page/2/#comment-11646857) the practice of [pressing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McAycEsJHfc) comic books to remove creases and other defects. [He owned](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/119896703/kingpin-comics/) a comic store in Tempe, Arizona called [Kingpin Comics](https://emuseum.tempe.gov/objects/55028/kingpin-comics--collectibles-943-south-48th-street-124). The name is rather ironic. In the Marvel Universe, Kingpin is a notorious villain - A crime lord with the outward persona of a legitimate businessman. At Kingpin Comics, Bulls offered comic book investment advice and, according to [an interview](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/119896703/kingpin-comics/) with The Daily Oklahoman, even put together investment portfolios for customers. He advertised this through [his column](https://www.cbr.com/where-to-begin-a-wizard-retrospective/) in Wizard Magazine.

To be clear, Greg Buls is not the only person who did this - The speculator market was hot and it was only natural that people start businesses to take advantage of the opportunities. What Buls specifically did, however, seems unique. [His model](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/10ks367/i_just_learned_about_kingpin_comics_a/) was based on the idea of a mutual fund - People would pay him a couple hundred dollars a month and, in exchange, he would purchase and hold onto comic books that he thought were worth speculating on, storing them in his warehouse to eventually be sold. He focused on [Image Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Comics) and [Valiant Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valiant_Comics), companies backed by big names like [Todd McFarlane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_McFarlane) and [Jim Shooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Shooter).

Unfortunately, this is where the story gets fuzzy. [Its clear](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/472612-combined-investment-will-cause-golden-age-collectors-to-explode/#comment-11301567) that Buls [wanted people to buy in](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/472597-rallyrd-that-old-idea-about-partial-ownership-of-comics-is-a-reality-updated-july-21-2021/page/5/#comment-11301647) to this, but its not clear how many people actually did. [One user](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/481257-new-interview-from-comicartads-phillip-anderson/#comment-11554571) on the CGC forums (a specialty forum for comic collectors) notes that Greg Buls is famously remembered for his part in fueling the comics speculator market in the early 90s, but this is just asserted as some kind of common knowledge. The soundness of his investment advice is questionable - [Another poster](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/469185-warren-magazines-in-high-grade/page/2/#comment-11205689) on the CGC forums said that he hyped [Wolverine #50](https://gocollect.com/comic/wolverine-50-1) and [Marvel Comics Presents #90](https://gocollect.com/comic/marvel-comics-presents-90), books worth maybe $100 in good condition today. Certainly no Action Comics #1. 

The most concrete information comes, again, from /u/Lorepedodontists original post. One of these customers, miffed that they had lost money and never seen their books, [sent a letter to Wizard Magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/10ks367/i_just_learned_about_kingpin_comics_a/j5twax5/) in 1995 asking what they should do. Wizard, perhaps recognizing their role in platforming Buls, his investment advice, and the advice of others, simply told the sender to Call your states district attorney. Kingpin Comics [stopped operating out-of-state](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/search/business) in 1995 and must have shut down sometime after that, as Arizona has no record of the business registration.

So where is Greg Buls today? He [popped up in the CGC forums in 2007](https://boards.cgccomics.com/topic/100185-bulldog-collectibles-are-scam-artists/?do=findComment&amp;comment=1812543), defending himself against accusations that hed ripped a comic buyer off on eBay. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem like that eBay shop exists anymore. The folks at the CGC forums seemed pretty welcoming towards him, even taking his side and defending him against those accusations. Ultimately, I dont want to cast judgment - A lot of the details of this have been lost to history or are only accessible in non-digitized copies of Wizard Magazine and Comic Buyers Guide.","HobbyDrama",95,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11h3pmx/comic_books_comic_book_mutual_funds_and_the_man/"

2023-02-14,1676412564,"Really struggling to move past my [40F] Boomer parents [70M, 70F] spending centuries of generational wealth","I know I need to get over this. My own mother [70F] said I'm going to get bitter and twisted over it. I really want help because the cost of living crisis in my country is making our finances tighter and tighter every month and it's driving a huge wedge into my relationship with my parents.

In the 50s and 60s my parents benefited from expensive private schooling and extremely wealthy parents - as well as all the other Boomer stuff that all the middle class Boomers got like cheap housing, jobs that paid well etc. My dad literally got given a partnership at a major law firm by my grandpa.

They had me in the 80s. They preferred my brother [38M] from the start, which doesn't help things. They foisted me off on my granny pretty much full time. But when I was 10 and they were 40, the age I am now, my mother inherited a buttload of money and they bought a huge 30 room mansion in the centre of our town outright - no mortgage.

I went to local state schools. I was bullied and ended up going to literally every school in town, because my mother cut my hair herself (very short), I wore free glasses and second hand clothing. I rarely got Christmas and birthday presents, and never birthday parties. The other kids were really confused, because well, we lived in a bloody mansion and my mum wasn't buying me sanitary products. She made me work in my dad's office under minimum wage at 12 to pay for them, and then in various local shops around the town.

Meanwhile my parents were living it up with two huge parties a year with 200+ people at a time, crates of wine, barrels of beer on tap etc. My mother bought curtains that cost £6k. That kind of thing. They inherited more huge lump sums over the years as various relatives died. My mother owns a diamond tiara, and has given away numerous fur coats.

I went to uni, and my loan was means assessed - but my parents didn't give the level of hand-outs that the government expected, so unlike poorer classmates I had to work through my degree.

My parents helped me with rent for a while, and did give me part of a deposit for my first house - about £10k, so, just over one and a half curtains. I was incredibly grateful at the time - of course I was. They also paid £7k for my wedding, and again, I was hugely grateful.

I'm not so grateful ten years later, and I really need help getting my shit into perspective. I'm still really privileged, but I'm struggling to remember it.

I have a daughter now. All my money goes to her schooling and the rest into savings for her. I look at my childhood (mentally - my parents never took photos) and at my tiny home and think wow, how great would it be to have no mortgage? How great would it be to afford a birthday party for my kid? How great would it be to take her abroad without saddling myself with huge, crippling debt?

And I look at my parents, proudly part of the SKI (Spending Kids' Inheritance) Club, going on their cruises, downsizing their house to a mere 4-bed so they can enjoy the last dregs of generations of wealth. And listen to them telling me that all we have to do is eat out less (less than once every six months?) and maybe we wouldn't have to worry about kitchen cupboard doors falling off.

My cousins went to private schools, then Oxford and Cambridge universities, subsequently working in high paid careers. They have been bought houses outright by their parents, flats in London, horses, ski holidays, you name it. And of course I get them asking why I can't be more like my cousins.

Meanwhile, for Christmas my parents bought me a pair of slippers off the internet.

How can I let this horrid sourness go? I know I need to. I can't keep feeling like this. I know we can all agree that the Boomers (yeah I know, Not All Boomers) have screwed over Millennials, but I feel like I'm Tiny Tim being given financial advice by Scrooge. It isn't good for my mental health OR my relationship with my parents, never mind their relationship with my daughter [7F] who's always asking why we can't live in a nice big house like Granny and Grampa and all their friends.

Edit: thank you all so much for your thoughts and advice. You're all right, in one way or another. This isn't about the money - I know I'm so much more privileged than other people. My husband has never had any financial assistance from his parents - but his parents love him. That's the difference. 

I don't know if I can bring myself to cut my parents off. But watching them be so caring to my own daughter is harder than it should be, because I see that in actual fact they ARE capable of being caring and loving to a little girl. Just not me, is all.","relationship_advice",219,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/112hmu0/really_struggling_to_move_past_my_40f_boomer/"

*Disclaimer: I felt it necessary to share this to a larger audience, warn other students and professionals, and bring awareness to the absolutely abhorrent behavior of a man who is actively involved in the education of medical students. I DID ALREADY POST* [*THIS*](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/110rcit/psa_since_many_people_seem_to_be_unaware_michael/) *IN* [r/step1](https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/) and [r/medicalschool](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/) *but I received several requests to share it here.*

Quick run down: Michael Mehlman is originally from the U.S. where he graduated undergrad from Boston University. He left to Australia to obtain his medical degree, and *~~allegedly~~* *(see below)* graduated, only to decide medicine was not for him and therefore ran off to Osaka, Japan. He now makes a living from [$374/hour tutoring services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/product/premium-tutoring-packages/) and [$260/hour ""dating"" coaching](https://mikemehlman.net/skype/).

As some of you may already be aware, and I'm sure many of you not, Michael Mehlman advertises his [services](https://mehlmanmedical.com/) as a premium 1-on-1 Tutoring for USMLE, CBSE/COMP, Shelf Exams, Clinical Rotations, Medical Coursework. Within the last 6-12 months, there has been a substantial increase in interest for his free PDFs, paid tutoring, paid Anki decks, and videos. **He also boasts a team of 21 physicians and medical students who he claims are involved in tutoring services.** Michael is known to be active on Reddit, promoting his services as well as *allegedly* harassing anyone who brings attention to what I am now.

Michael [claims](https://www.studentdoctor.net/author/michael-mehlman/) (in multiple [places](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/)) to have graduated from University of Queensland in the MD-MPhil program in [May 2016](https://mikemehlman.net/2018/10/29/how-to-be-more-happy/), however, a brief search of [UQ SOM clinician scientist student page](https://medical-school.uq.edu.au/clinician-scientist-track-md-phd-and-md-mphil) (MD/PhD and MD/MPhil) does not include Michael. This page includes all students and graduates dating back to 2012. [The UQSOM c/o 2016 also graduated in December, not may.](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1291192920955384&amp;type=3) But again, probably a rational explanation for all this.

He also lists his credentials as [MD-MPhil](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/) (*masters* of philosophy) but his credentials as a First Aid author in 2015 lists him as an [MD-PhD candidate](https://mehlmanmedical.com/usmle-credentials/). In addition, it states that he was in his **sixth** and final year of his program and yet (*at the time of his enrollment)* the MPhil route did not offer a six year option, only [four or five](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1337-5). The PhD route offered a six year option, but per Michael's website, [he did not pursue and obtain a PhD](https://mehlmanmedical.com/our-team/). Again, no accusations here, just observations.

**Edit: a user has pointed out that you can** [**search**](https://academic-records.uq.edu.au/search) **for qualifications of previous UQ students. Michael does appear to have been awarded a Master of Philosophy in 06/2015 and a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) in 07/2016.**

None the less, that is the least of my concerns. As I was googling, trying to find his educational website, I stumbled upon (and by that I mean it is *literally* the [first result](https://www.google.com/search?q=michael+mehlman&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS942US942&amp;oq=michael+mehlman&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59l4j0i512j69i60l3.2566j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) when you search his name) his [alternative website](https://mikemehlman.net/) **with his educational website very clearly linked in the main menu.**

**I've seen many recent posts and comments about female students utilizing his tutoring services only to be seduced, invited to Japan to live with him, and subjected to creepy, predatory, misogynistic comments**. Upon further investigation and talking to women from these posts and privately, this his happened more than acceptable (with acceptable being *obviously* for this to never happen). For privacy sake, I am not going to link their posts or profiles but I will share proof via DM if anyone is wanting.

Of course, everyone is entitled to their own personal interests/habits/activities, and one's character as an educator and medical professional should *generally* not be judged upon those personal attributes. However, I think it is absolutely deplorable that he openly promotes this ideology while simultaneously promoting his medical resources and services.

Here are some examples of his sexual/dating advice from various blog posts:

""...***I will now take my clothes off despite her being unwilling to take hers off***. I will stand up, take my shirt off, and then start taking my pants off.""

*""****If she \*still\* refuses****, but is clearly willing to touch you, you can stand and* ***put it in her face***, and shell take it, OR if she rejects putting it in her mouth after youve put it in her face, ***you can usually get an HJ out of it.""***

*""****She then says, Haha no.*** *And you say, Thats all we have to do. We dont have to have sex. I dont want to have sex.* ***Just lets get your clothes off and we can touch****, thats it.""*

*""After Im in my underwear,* ***I will just pull it out***\*, even if Im not hard, and ***put it in her face*** *as shes sitting off the side of my bed.""*

*""My point is that you should be trying* ***repeatedly to fight through her resistance*** *in an effort to get her home...pushing anywhere between 10-20x over several minute.""*

*""So you literally have* ***zero to lose by being an unrelenting asshole*** *who pushes 20x.""*

""***Regardless of the degree of resistance she puts up*** *when I attempt to bring her hands toward my chest, the next thing I do is roll up my shirt just above the level of my nipples and* ***then take her hands again and put them on my chest***.""

***""When shes not allowing you to take her clothes off***, what you do is essentially enter repeated cycles of engagement-disengagement-engagement-disengagement...***Then you again attempt to take her shirt off***. She again ***resists***. You then once again disengage.""

2023-02-19,1676817217,"Can you actually RAW use dispel magic to destroy a permanent teleportation circle?","**TL;DR:** 1. *Dispel Magic* only ends Spells, not other magical effects; 2. A permanent teleportation circle **is not** the spell *teleportation circle* with permanent duration; 3. Therefore *Dispel Magic* can't be used on a permanent teleportation circle

In preparation for my new campaign I once again dove into the mechanics of teleportation circles and specifically, how other DMs protect them from being easily destroyed by *Dispel Magic*. After all, casting a 5th level spell for a year and using 20k gold is a lot of effort for something that a 3rd level spell could easily destroy.

I found many proposed solutions, from casting the spell with a higher spell slot, restricting access in 120ft (the range of dispel magic) around the circle, to surrounding the circle with walls or burying it, to break line of sight. Clearly this is a common concern among DMs, that they tried to fix best as they could. However, after reading the specific rules of both *Dispel Magic* and *Telportation Circle*, I don't think anymore they are necessary. 

I believe *Dispel Magic* can't actually dispel a permanent teleportation circle. At least RAW.

1. *Dispel Magi*c only ends spells. It doesn't end other magical effects ( [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA179](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA179)).

2. Despite it's name, a permanent teleportation circle **is not** the spell *Teleportation Circle* with a permanent duration. They are in fact very different things.

This might seem strange at first, but there are many points supporting this statment. First, spell names are usually italicized, but the permanent teleportation circle is not. Furthermore, the spell states that casting it over a year **creates** a permanent teleportation circle, not that it changes the duration of the spell. If you compare similiar spells like *forbiddance* or *Druid Grove*, both have the spell name italicized and specifically mention its duration becoming permanent.

This point also shows why this sage advice ([https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA147](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA147)) doesn't apply to this situation, despite explicitly mentioning permanent spells as dispellable. 

To clarify, look at [https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA180](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/sac/sage-advice-compendium#SA180). It only mentions instantaneous spells, but it applies to all spells with effects not bound to their duration. In this case, you cast the spell teleportation circle with a duration of 1 round. After it ends, it creates a permanent teleportation circle. If someone else wants to use *Dispel Magic* on it now, they can't, because there is no spell with an active duration to dispel, as it has already ended. Therefore you can't use *Dispel Magic* on a permanent teleportation circle.

Looking at it from the other side: If *Dispel Magic* could dispel a permanent teleportation circle, it would have to function like a teleportation circle with a permanent duration. That would mean it would have a shimmering portal permanently in its middle, that would have to be linked to one other permanent teleportation circle, as this is exactly what the spell does. Not only would this be kind of weird in universe, as anyone who wants to create a permanent teleportation circle would need to know of another permanent teleportation circle to link to. Furthermore that circle would have to be linked to yet another circle, creating a conga line of teleportation circles. Not only would this be a logistical nightmare, all these circles could also be used without expending a single spell slot. I don't think any DM has actually ruled permanent teleportation circles working this way, and it also doesn't match their description in other sources.

Considering all this, I think it just makes sense that dispel magic doesn't affect permanent teleportation circles, just like it doesn't affect other things created by spells.

Is this actually RAW? I haven't played DnD very long so I don't know if I haven't made a mistake somewhere. I'd like to hear from more experienced DMs if this is indeed RAW.","dndnext",263,"https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/116c6q4/can_you_actually_raw_use_dispel_magic_to_destroy/"

2023-03-06,1678071680,"Take The Money and Run: Reject The Ivy, Take The State School","Former A2Cer here (I deleted my old Reddit account after my college journey, but recently rejoined!), current college junior. My advice will only apply to a select portion of you, but I hope this advice helps even one person as they navigate their college decisions. Today, I am going to talk about my experience rejecting two HYPSM universities to attend a state school on a full-ride and why it was, without a doubt, the best decision I have made in my entire life. 

For context, I applied to 11 colleges and universities for social sciences programs. I didnt come from an elite high school or wealthy area; I used free online resources to prepare for every essay and scholarship interviewthank you A2C for connecting me with tips that changed my future!

Spring of my senior year, I was unbelievably fortunate enough to have earned admittance into 8 colleges. Two public schools gave me full rides. Another public school and a private school gave me full tuition. Two public schools gave me partial merit scholarships. And two were ivies that offered about $30k/yr in needs-based aid. 

While your admissions profile may look different than mine, as regular decisions roll out, you might be lucky enough to face the same debate: do I take a scholarship from my state school, or do I take on debt for the bigger-name school?

My answer: take the fucking money and run.

I (graciously, tears-in-my-eyes, doing somersaults, etc.) accepted a full-ride to a state school. Rejecting my offers from the ivies killed me& for about two seconds. Then I celebrated beginning the next chapter of my life. 

I didnt realize what full cost of attendance would really feel like until I was actually living it: going to on-campus festivals, watching free sporting events, buying Starbucks everyday with my scholarship money, using my scholarship refunds to buy my laptop and school supplies. I work two jobs throughout the school year, and I am able to put my earnings into a savings account rather than funneling every spare dollar into reducing my college debt. Without worrying about money, I am able to enjoy more volunteer opportunities: participating in student clubs, volunteering in the local community, travelling for spring and winter breaks. This has allowed me to build my resume and devote more time to applying for job opportunities, attending campus events, etc.

This semester, my university bill was negative. My school owed ME money for me to receive my college education. I, by some insane miracle, profit from taking classes. I use this money towards dorm supplies, textbooks, and, admittedly, some fun purchases (thrifting with friends, buying dinner at local restaurants). And you might be able to live like a king too if you take the money and run.

When I asked this sub years ago if I should take a full-ride over an ivy, I was told I would be ruining opportunities. If I went to an ivy league school, I would have taken $100,000 in student loans and paid $1,000 a month every month for years to pay down my debt. A state school gave me the opportunity of financial freedom: an opportunity few ever get to experience.

It doesnt matter the name of the university; at least, it doesnt matter as much as you think. What matters is your quality of life, the fit of the university for your academic, social, and emotional needs, and (because, after all, you want to be employed someday) what your resume looks like at the end of the four years. At my own university, I have been published in multiple national magazines, earned funding to speak at research conferences, found a job experience in my desired field as a freshman, interned at top orgs in my field, and rose to the top of student orgsnot because of my universitys name, but because taking the money and running gave me the enormous privilege to focus on my career development, friends, and interests, not paying off debt.

I understand this post comes from an enormous place of privilege. I do not intend to write this to brag (if I was hungry for external validation, I wouldve taken the ivy lmao.) My parents were first gen students who paid every cent for their education themselves. 

I write this to help that student who is on the fence, who worries about taking the financially safe option instead of the prestigious option. I write to tell that student that you will be a great student no matter where you go, not because of the name, but because of who you are.

I specifically want to discuss how I believe their weapon works and what we can glean from the lore.*

For those who can't see [the image I've shown](https://imgur.com/a/k5NzBCG) or haven't seen the trailer, in it we see the bottom of one of the Pyramid ships light up in the familiar ""resonance"" orange we have come to associate with the Darkness before unleashing it in a seismic shockwave that takes out a number of ships that it touches.

Now one can not help but be reminded of the ""[sonic mines](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Seismic_charge/Legends)"" deployed by Jango Fett against Obi Wan in Star Wars. Here we see a similar blue shockwave being emitted that is capable of slicing an asteroid in two. Of course the idea of a mine that uses sound or seismic vibrations in space is... ridiculous. There is no medium for either of these to travel along.

However, while mechanical waves require a medium, energy can still travel in waves through space by other means. As electromagnetic waves for instance, which we perceive as light and heat. And as recently as 2015 we observed for the first time the waves of another force of nature: gravity.

# Gravitational Waves

&gt;"" Gravity is the weakest force, yet it chooses the shape of the universe. Thus, subtlety triumphs.""

Our relationship with gravity is a relatively simple. We experience a constant downward acceleration towards the earth, stopped only by the earth crust or some other means of cheating gravity. When we lift things we experience the force of gravity acting on the mass of the object as weight. We may have even experienced the feeling of weightlessness when we are at the zenith of a roller coaster.

But venture beyond the comfortable Newtonian constraints of our Earth and we quickly realize that gravity is a lot more complex. According to general relativity, gravity is not a force that is transmitted between objects, but rather it is a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. We've all seen the representation of this as [a bowling ball on a trampoline](https://images.theconversation.com/files/485636/original/file-20220920-23-pg5fnk.png). The trampoline represents the fabric of spacetime. The bowling ball, a heavy mass like our sun, that distorts this fabric and causes lighter objects, like a golf ball, to accelerate towards the bowling ball once this depression is made.

It's a handy way to imagine 4 dimensional spacetime in a two dimensional representation. It can also helping us visualize another phenomenon. Imagine you place your hand on that bowling ball and start to wobble it back and forth. With enough vibrational force and depending on the elasticity of the fabric, you would start to see ripples of energy travelling outwards across the fabric of the trampoline. These can be understood as [Gravitational Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave).

Just like light, gravity can travels in waves. These ripples in the fabric of spacetime propagate at the speed of light too. Normally however these waves are far too weak to detect. We can only observe them in truly cataclysmic events in nature, for instance when massive objects like Black Holes or Neutron Stars orbit or collide.

However, if theres one thing we've learned in Destiny it is that truly massive astronomical phenomena like stars, black holes and supernovae can be replicated on a localised scale with enough paracausal energy. When it comes to gravitational waves I have no doubt that this is what we witness from the Pyramids. How do we know this?

# High Frequency, High Amplitude

&gt;""Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves.""

Let's consider one of our most detailed encounters with a Pyramid ship during the collapse onboard the Yang Liwei in [Cosmogyre III](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/cosmogyre-iii).

&gt;An incredible sensation washes over Captain Li. A rumble and a thrum down in her gut, in her marrow, in the lowest, basest elements of her body. **It is the vibration, the sound of the very fabric of her being scrunching up and stretching out; the distance between the atoms of her body collapses, then expands.** The cycle repeats again and again. For a moment, she feels her fingertips and toes pulled away from her core, yanked by tidal forces. It feels like the lowest rumble of the biggest subwoofer ever built. It sounds like the deep voice of God whispering ASMR directly into her ear. It tingles, it thrills, and it leaves in its wake a subsonic tint of dread and anticipation.  
&gt;  
&gt;She shivers. ""**Gravity wave**,"" she says. ""Talk to me, Geode.""  
&gt;  
&gt;The Space-Time Geodesics Officer looks like she's just been hand-delivered a Nobel. ""This is amazing!"" she crows, fully aware that she and everyone else are about to die, but transported away from such temporal concerns by scientific rapture. ""**Can you feel that growl? We're experiencing high-frequency, high-amplitude gravity waves**. Phaeton strikes. Axions decaying through the hull. Sterile neutrinos. It's all coming from a source at bearing, uh, zero four five mark zero three zero relative, rangerange highly variable.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Another wave tears through Yang Liwei. **Everything in the ship simultaneously compresses and stretches as the gravity wave deforms the space-time metric.** ""Is it the phantom?"" Li demands, as her ship thrums subsonically. ""Is that phantom ship emitting these waves?""

This is clear evidence that the Pyramid ships are capable of producing these gravitational waves. But there is something very important to note here. In real life, the first detected gravitational waves were produced by the collision of two black holes about 1.3 billion light-years away. These had a wavelength of [about 1000 km](https://medium.com/@adammann930/how-well-explore-the-gravity-wave-spectrum-9c0fbba90984).

But what's interesting is that these Pyramid-generated gravitational waves are not gently undulating waves of gravity with a long wave length. No, these are high frequency gravitational waves with a **short wave length**, down to the distance between the atoms of her body. We have another example too with Ana's experience on the edge of our system that confirms this.

A slow wrinkle skulks across space. It presses up the fabric. Insignificant points between stars warp and spur small disturbances in the constellational congruence of the galaxy. From afar it is nothing. A flutter of wings in wind.

&gt;||**GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ANOMALY DETECTED**: JUMP HAZARDLOCATION INCONCLUSIVE, CLEAR HAZARD||  
&gt;  
&gt;Feels strange. Jinju is distant. We should go.  
&gt;  
&gt;||GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ANOMALY DETECTED||  
&gt;  
&gt;The ship lurches. Anas stomach churns. **Jinju vibrates violently in place**, an outer shell of Light absorbing some form of force.

We can almost imagine the effects gravitational waves could have on our own body. It would depend on the strength and frequency of the waves. If the waves were strong enough, they could cause our body to stretch and compress in different directions. This could create a sensation of weightlessness followed by a sudden increase in weight as the wave passed through. As the frequency of the waves increased, our body would start to vibrate, and different parts of the body would experience different levels of stretching and compression.

At very high frequencies, the vibrations could affect the fluid in our inner ear, causing a ghostly tinnitus to ring. As the waves became even more intense, the body could experience an indescribably deep sensation, as though it was on the verge of being ripped apart at the quantum level.

Now that we can appreciate the effects that high frequency gravitational waves are capable of, how exactly are the Pyramids able to cause such a disturbance in the fabric of spacetime?

# Lambda-field Influence

&gt;""A change in the cosmological constant lambda, signaling a dark energy event""

You will remember the [last days on Kraken Mare](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/sundown-distress). It's inhabitants witnessed first hand the utter destruction it was capable of. A syzygy of sorts. The very ocean of Titan was being ""pulled"" upwards.

&gt;Satellite lidar confirms a **tidal bulge of 40 meters**400, repeat, 400 percent of ordinary tidal deformation and growing. We anticipate massive cryoseismic activity as the tidal effect recedes. Total crustal reflex will trigger a multiple hypocenter icequake swarm. Surface effects catastrophic.

And the cause?

&gt;We are experiencing massive tidal forces of unknown origin. Our physics cluster detects mass growl, phaeton strikes, and sterile neutrino scattering. **Possible origins include a compact dark matter object, a lambda-field influence, or a polarized gravity device.**

It's unsurprising that dark radiation such as sterile neutrinos, axions and the dark phaetons associated with dark matter should be present in virtually every situation the Pyramids are encountered in offensively. After all, dark matter in most cases is believed to only interact with gravity. It would take a strong tidal force of gravitational waves to scatter them in one direction so they can be detected.

We also see mention of ""mass growl"" which is also reported by Yang Liwei. But of particular notice is the end: ""a lambda-field influence, or a polarized gravity device"".

CDM, also known as the [Lambda cold dark matter model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model), is the currently accepted model of the universe that explains its evolution and structure. The CDM in CDM stands for [cold dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_dark_matter), a type of matter that does not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation and thus cannot be directly observed. But the  (Lambda) in CDM is what we are really interested in. It refers to the [Cosmological Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant), a term in general relativity that represents **the energy of empty space**.

The cosmological constant is sometimes referred to as a ""field"" because it can be thought of as a uniform distribution of energy throughout the universe. It has been used to explain the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe, which is attributed to a mysterious ""[Dark Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy)"" that pervades all of space.

If we read the K1 Codes and Procedures manual it explains it as such:

&gt;LAMBDA VARIANT. **A change in the cosmological constant lambda, signaling a dark energy event.** A local rip event will catastrophically disassemble the cladding and all nearby organized matter above the quark level.

# Dark Energy

&gt;""Dark energy yawns in the space between all things, ever-growing, ever-spreading. ""

Now dark energy is not expected to directly produce gravitational waves, however, the presence of dark energy can [indirectly affect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05760) the production and propagation of gravitational waves through its effect on the expansion of the universe. Dark energy is believed to be responsible for the observed [acceleration of the expansion of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe), which causes the gravitational waves to be redshifted or stretched out as they travel through the expanding universe.

While dark energy and gravity are fundamentally different phenomena, they both have effects on the geometry of space-time. **Gravity causes space-time to curve,** while **dark energy causes it to expand at an accelerated rate.** So, in this sense, dark energy can be thought of as a kind of repulsive gravity, because it counteracts the effects of gravity and causes space-time to expand rather than contract.

If we go back to our trampoline analogy, instead of a flat trampoline, imagine a trampoline with a [constant force pushing upward from underneath](https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/91-914468_space-time-anti-gravity-hd-png-download.png). This force represents the effects of dark energy. As objects are placed on the trampoline, they continue to be attracted to each other by the force of gravity, but now they also experience a **repulsive force** from the dark energy pushing them apart.

Now I have already discuss dark energy manipulation with regards to [Void Light](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/mgn0e6/the_secrets_of_void_light_demystified/), and how the energy of the fabric of space could be used to distort gravity and time. We also see lambda-field manipulation used in many novel ways. We saw it used by Clovis Bray in the K1 cladding to ""smooth"" the gravitational footprint of its enormous mass by surrounding it in a moat of dark energy.

&gt;**The anomaly is suspended in a null-gravity field by lambda smoothing circuit.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The empty Procedure Five moat conducts monitoring of the **virtual-particle flux in the vacuum**, as well as **geodesic analysis of the quantum foam texture and the structure of local spacetime**. Laser interferometry **detects gravity waves and lambda field events**. The gravity wave antennae in this layer can be used to transmit as well as receive.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Unsmoothed mass approximately 23200000000000000000000 kilograms**. Consequences of lambda field suspension failure disastrous. Consequences of electroweak matter instability catastrophic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do not remove from **lambda field suspension**. Do not interfere with quark confinement clamp systems.

We also recently learned it was used offensively by the Cabal in the Almighty in order to weaken the gravitational forces holding a star together and stopping it from going supernova.

&gt;My father's face bulges through the sun-devouring maw of the wooden prototype. The actual warship will **dampen gravity with a lambda-smoothing effect**, so that its target star cannot hold itself together against the blast of its own heart.

These are all likely manipulations of void energy that we know different civilizations have access too, just like they do with [arc](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/shock-grenade) and [solar](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/slap-rifle).

# Phantom Energy

&gt;""An energetic event within the cladding has tunneled into a lower-energy vacuum state. The total annihilation of the containment site is imminent, followed by the remainder of the solar system""

But what the Pyramids do is much much different. Incredibly violent. Imagine that you are able to physically grab the fabric of the trampoline, pull it upwards with such force and then release it. This would not only send ripples but it would be like a whiplash on the fabric of spacetime itself.

Not all forms of hypothetical dark energy can achieve this. Void energy for instance is associated more closely with [Quintessence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintessence) a hypothetical type of dark energy with a **positive pressure** which causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate. It's [evil twin](https://www.space.com/dark-gravity-phantom-energy) however, is **phantom energy**.

[Phantom energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_energy) is characterized by negative pressure and this causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate **even more rapidly than that predicted by quintessence!** Unlike quintessence, the phantom energy field is unbounded from below, which means that it could potentially become **infinitely negative** and cause the universe to experience a nightmare scenario known as the ""[Big Rip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip)"".

If dark energy increased without limit it could overcome all forces that hold the universe together, every structure would be ""ripped apart"" at the quantum level. The progression of time itself will stop. It would truly turn our world as we know it upside down. Like flipping the trampoline.

(If you're interested I have actually [talked about Phantom Energ](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/kx7sfp/dark_phantom_energy_may_be_the_antithesis_of_void/)y before)

This is what I honestly believe the Pyramids are truly capable of. Vibrating the fabric of space time at incredibly high amplitude and frequencies that it is able to cause gravitational disturbances at the quantum level. But knowing that it create spacetime waves in such incredibly high frequencies means that it is also hypothetically capable of so much more.

# Resonance

&gt;""The Ziggurat resonates like a tuning fork. The vibrations themselves take shape within the smoke. Echoes radiate from the black deep like graviton ripples through space.""

Think back to sound waves. When two sound waves of the same frequency and amplitude meet in phase (i.e., the peaks and troughs of the waves align), they reinforce each other and create a louder sound. This is known as [constructive interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference). This can also cause the medium they are traveling through to vibrate at its natural frequency, which is known as [Resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance).

We have all seen [the effect](https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/how-high-must-you-sing-to-shatter-a-wine-glass/) of this before too. When a singer sings a note, their vocal cords vibrate at a particular frequency, which produces sound waves that travel through the air. If the frequency of the sound waves matches the resonant frequency of the glass, the glass can begin to vibrate and with enough decibels: **shatter**.

So if it's true of sound waves, is it also true of gravitational waves?

There is a very good article if you get a chance to read it called [How the Physics of Resonance Shapes Reality](https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-physics-of-resonance-shapes-reality/). In it, it talks about the unmistakable signature of resonance, one of the most ubiquitous phenomena in nature.

&gt;Just like a wine glass, an atom only absorbs energy from waves with specific frequencies, and it can also shed energy by emitting waves with those same frequencies. Quantum theory revealed that **the structure of atoms**, no less than the structure of symphonies, **is intimately tied to resonance**.  
&gt;  
&gt;In quantum field theory, the universes truly elementary entities are fields that fill all space. **Particles are localized, resonant excitations of these fields, vibrating like springs in an infinite mattress.** The frequencies at which quantum fields prefer to vibrate stem from fundamental constants whose origins remain obscure; these frequencies in turn determine the masses of the corresponding particles. Blast the vacuum of empty space hard enough at the right frequency, and out will pop a bunch of particles.

I've actually went into the idea of ""quantum resonance"" in my last post ""[Strand Unraveled](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/10ucnie/strand_unraveled_the_unification_of_string_theory/)"" where I explained that the phenomenon of resonance even applies down to the one dimensional strings that make up all matter according to String Theory. This is unsurprising considering we learned in an interview:

&gt;We always tried to relate everything back to the initial Darkness language of resonance. You can see that in Stasis where you have these Cymatics-like patterns on everything, the way the crystals fester and move, all of that is to reinforce that this is from the same power suite. Strand is no different, right?

So if the Pyramids are able to vibrate the very fabric of spacetime at such high amplitudes and high frequencies, we can already imagine the destructive result once it hits certain resonant frequencies of matter at the quantum level.

# Battle Made Waves

&gt;He called on the Deep, saying:  I can see you in the sky. You are the waves, which are battles, and the battles are the waves.

So now I want to theorize on this shockwave we see emanating from the Pyramid in this epic battle between the forces of Darkness and Light. I believe it is a Gravitomagnetic Pulse or GMP.

[Gravitomagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitoelectromagnetism) is a widely used term referring specifically to the kinetic effects of gravity, in analogy to the magnetic effects of moving electric charge. It's not saying that gravity is electromagnetism, but rather that when masses move, they generate a ""gravitomagnetic field"" that is similar to the magnetic field generated by moving electric charges in electromagnetism.

At high frequencies and amplitudes, gravity starts to behave in ways that we would associate more closely with electromagnetism. One possible similarity is an EMP, or [Electromagnetic Pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse). An EMP sends a brief but powerful burst of electromagnetic energy. If it's powerful enough it can severely damage electronic equipment.

How much damage it can cause depends on how efficiently the conductor can absorb the energy of the EMP. A phenomenon known as the ""[antenna effect](https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/pdf/2017/53/matecconf_icmite2017_00159.pdf)"" suggests that maximum efficiency will occur if the wires and cables that run through the device are resonant with the frequency of the EMP.

I believe something very similar is happening with the Pyramids. A short but extremely powerful **gravitomagnetic pulse** induced by **dark energy** that causes the fundamental fields of matter to **resonate** at just the right frequency and so strongly that **it compromises it's very integrity**.

We can now understand both the cause and the effect. But now we must go beyond and look at the paracausal nature of it. Specifically it's relationship with consciousness.

# Neural Oscillations

&gt;""Eris Morn has informed me that the fungus is similar to a synapse within a nervous system.""

We know that the Egregore fungus is a vast mycelial network that behaves almost like neurons in a vast paracausal neural network. What's more this network connects the Witness to the Pyramids psychically and the spores of the egregore allow one to temporarily join their mind with this network since the egregore resonates with the Darkness.

&gt;The egregore connects points of Darkness, resonates with Pyramid constructs.  
&gt;  
&gt;You know& it sings if you burn it just right."" Drifter thumbs behind him. ""Sub-sonic, resonates in a funny way with Pyramid tech.""

Now if we can predispose the existence of paracausal neurons that can think across the void then what about brain waves?

Brain waves (or [Neural oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_oscillation)) are, essentially, the evidence of electrical activity produced by your brain. When a group of neurons sends a burst of electrical pulses to another group of neurons, it creates a wave-like pattern. This activity can even be picked up by magnetic **resonance** imaging. Perhaps a similar thing is happening with the Pyramids except with gravity and dark energy?

&gt;The Ziggurat **resonates like a tuning fork**. **The vibrations themselves take shape within the smoke**, and Eris is drawn toward somewhere distant and empty. She follows, and the smoke swirls with points of color like stars, separated by lonely rifts of black expanse. **Echoes radiate from the black deep like graviton ripples through space.** They wash distortion over the stars until breaking against four other pointstwo greater, two weaker**ghostly strands of incorporeal egregore between them.**

We also know that our brain activity not only involves ionic currents and charges traveling among the brain's neurons but that the masses of these charges also give rise to [extremely weak gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1635). If high frequency gravitational waves can effect our body, it's just as likely that would also **affect the mind** which is infinitely more sensitive to changes. This could explain so many things the Darkness is capable of, including the Noetic effects the K1 team experienced.

We do read however in Kuangs Logbook regarding the artifact:

&gt;If the field spikes, it could force our nerves to fire, even drive us into seizure. High-Tesla magnetic fields do strange things to the mind.

But then further down we read:

&gt;Our antenna, like the artifact, simply shuffles its internal state through an apparently arbitrary series of gravitational and electronuclear permutations. These unified-force events were probably common in the early universe.

So perhaps this is the real power behind paracausal resonance. Could these high frequency quantum waves all be tied paracausally to the neural oscillations of some vast mind? Could this explain both the noetic effects as well as the intense gravitational waves?

These are questions for another day, I suppose.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

**TL;DR:** *I believe that the superweapon used by the Pyramids is a gravitomagnetic pulse, an extremely high-frequency high-amplitude shockwave of gravitational energy that causes matter to resonate and shatter. I believe this pulse is induced by a type of dark energy known as phantom energy which aggressively oscillates the fabric of spacetime itself to cause the structures of reality itself to rip apart. I also believe this is ultimately produced by neural oscillations or brain waves of a vast paracausal mind that reifies topologically in our reality as resonant quantum waves.*","DestinyLore",88,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyLore/comments/11bpy9h/the_sheer_power_of_the_pyramids_explained/"

2023-02-14,1676412034,"Megathread: Updates Regarding UFO Shootdowns Last Weekend","Over the past four days the U.S. military shot down three unidentified objects: the first on Friday near Deadhorse, Alaska, the second over Yukon, Canada, on Saturday and the latest on Sunday over Lake Huron, Michigan. The White House held press briefings [yesterday (Monday)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GQmzVDJIL8) and [today (Tuesday)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PTYDJxRbHQ) where multiple questions were asked regarding the situation. 


&amp;nbsp;

The intelligence community believes the three objects shot down could just be balloons tied to some commercial or benign purpose, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. 

We dont see anything that points right now to these being part of the \[Peoples Republic of China\] spy balloon program or in fact, intelligence collection against the United States of any kind, Kirby said.

On Monday, the US Navy salvage operations were reported to have recovered debris from the Chinese balloon which was shot down on February 4th off the coast of South Carolina. Crews found all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure.

Crews are still trying to recover the three other objects that were recently shot down and have been impeded by weather conditions. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Brussels Tuesday that two were in extremely remote areas while the third was under about 200 feet of water in Lake Huron.

Well get them eventually, but its gonna take some time to recover, he said. Other officials did not offer similar assurance.

We are working very hard to locate them, but theres no guarantee that we will. The terrain in the Yukon is rather treacherous right now so it could pose some significant challenges to us in in terms of our recovery efforts the same could be said about whats taking place in Lake Huron, the marine conditions are also not conducive at the moment, said Sean McGillis, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 

&amp;nbsp;

Senators attended a classified briefing today (Tuesday) and were updated on the situation.

Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, told reporters afterwards ""this is a new phenomenon"" and described the last three objects shot down as ""very, very small objects"" and were much smaller than a car. He said at least one of the three objects carried a payload, but declined to give details. 

Sen. Marco Rubio stressed that unidentified objects over U.S. airspace is not new  but the strategy to shoot them down is. He also called on the Biden administration to share more information with the general public.

""Ninety-five percent of what was discussed in that room today could be made public without compromising the security of this country,"" he said.

Sen. Thom Tillis said theres little information on the latest objects because they have not been able to recover anything as they have off the coast of the Carolinas. Defense and intelligence officials also are still not classifying the downed UFOs other than to say they are objects, and there are no signs of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.

Theyre not at a stage where theyre going to categorically identify them. Theyre balloons, blimps, a number of other things. Theyre not from outer space, Tillis said. 

[When asked](https://twitter.com/UAPJames/status/1625544523781664768) if he thought the objects posed a threat, Sen. John Kennedy said the only thing I feel confident saying right now is that if you are confused: you understand the situation perfectly.

This is what I took away: This has been going on for years, said Kennedy. Number two, except for the China spy balloon, we dont really know what they are. Number three, we dont even know if weve caught all of them. Number four, whats different right now is that weve shot some down. Thats the good news, I suppose.

I dont think anybody really understands, said Sen. Tommy Tuberville. We all knew what the first one was & \[The Biden administration\] took so much heat after the first one, they werent going to make the same mistake, he added, and let the objects fly untouched.

There is a tendency on this subreddit and other places similar to it online to post breathless, gushing commentary on the capabilities of the large language model, ChatGPT. I see people [asking the chatbot questions and treating the results as a revelation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/110okkw/chatgpt_on_what_the_ultimate_version_of_ai_will/). We see [venture capitalists preaching its revolutionary potential to juice stock prices or get other investors to chip in too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10qvt8l/chatgpt_is_just_the_beginning_artificial/) Or even [highly impressionable lonely men projecting the illusion of intimacy onto ChatGPT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kQFure4hdDmRBNdH/how-it-feels-to-have-your-mind-hacked-by-an-ai).

It needs to stop. You need to stop. Just stop.

ChatGPT is impressive in its ability to mimic human writing. But that's all its doing -- mimicry. When a human uses language, there is an intentionality at play, an idea that is being communicated: some thought behind the words being chosen deployed and transmitted to the reader, who goes through their own interpretative process and places that information within the context of their own understanding of the world and the issue being discussed.

ChatGPT cannot do the first part. It does not have intentionality. It is not capable of original research. It is not a knowledge creation tool. It does not meaningfully curate the source material when it produces its summaries or facsimiles.

If I asked ChatGPT to write a review of Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, it will not critically assess the qualities of that film. It will not understand the wizardry of its practical effects in context of the 1970s film landscape. It will not appreciate how the script, while being a trope-filled pastiche of 1930s pulp cinema serials, is so finely tuned to deliver its story with so few extraneous asides, and how it is able to evoke a sense of a wider lived-in universe through a combination of set and prop design plus the naturalistic performances of its characters.

Instead it will gather up the thousands of reviews that actually did mention all those things and mush them together, outputting a reasonable approximation of a film review.

Crucially, if all of the source material is bunk, the output will be bunk. Consider the ""I asked ChatGPT what future AI might be capable of"" post I linked: If the preponderance of the source material ChatGPT is considering is written by wide-eyed enthusiasts with little grasp of the technical process or current state of AI research but an invertebrate fondness for Isaac Asimov stories, then the result will reflect that. 

What I think is happening, here, when people treat ChatGPT like a knowledge creation tool, is that people are projecting their own hopes, dreams, and enthusiasms onto the results of their query. Much like the owner of the parrot, we are amused at the result, imparting meaning onto it that wasn't part of the creation of the result. The lonely deluded rationalist didn't fall in love with an AI; he projected his own yearning for companionship onto a series of text in the same way an anime fan might project their yearning for companionship onto a dating sim or cartoon character. 

It's the interpretation process of language run amok, given nothing solid to grasp onto, that treats mimicry as something more than it is.


EDIT:

Seeing as this post has blown up a bit (thanks for all the ornamental doodads!) I thought I'd address some common themes in the replies:

1: Ah yes but have you considered that humans are just robots themselves? Checkmate, atheists!

A: Very clever, well done, but I reject the premise. There are certainly deterministic *systems* at work in human physiology and psychology, but there is not at present sufficient evidence to prove the hard determinism hypothesis - and until that time, I will continue to hold that consciousness is an emergent quality from complexity, and not at all one that ChatGPT or its rivals show any sign of displaying.

I'd also proffer the opinion that the belief that humans are but meat machines is *very* convenient for a certain type of would-be Silicon Valley ubermensch and i ask you to interrogate why you hold that belief.

1.2: But ChatGPT is capable of building its own interior understanding of the world!

Memory is not interiority. That it can remember past inputs/outputs is a technical accomplishment, but not synonymous with ""knowledge."" It lacks a wider context and understanding of those past inputs/outputs.

2: You don't understand the tech! 

I understand it well enough for the purposes of the discussion over whether or not the machine is a knowledge producing mechanism.

Again. What it can do is impressive. But what it can do is more limited than its most fervent evangelists say it can do. 

3: Its not about what it can do, its about what it will be able to do in the future!

I am not so proud that when the facts change, I won't change my opinions. Until then, I will remain on guard against hyperbole and grift.

4: Fuck you, I'm going to report you to Reddit Cares as a suicide risk! Trolololol!

Thanks for keeping it classy, Reddit, I hope your mother is proud of you.

I believe this should be investigated as the receipts at the DTCC will not back up these trades similar to how Bernie Madoff scammed the world in the largest case of financial fraud in history.

Gen Z is gonna kick arse and take names and I hope I live long enough to see it. So thank you all so much for the kind words, the hugs, and the love.

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10kfmvi/my_21m_boyfriend_refuses_to_get_a_job_and_it_is/) (25 Jan 23)


**My (21M) boyfriend refuses to get a job and it is ruining our relationship (19F)**


I, F(19) have been with my boyfriend M(21) for just under a year, 11 months or so.

I finished college with great qualifications (I live in England for context) as I have always been a hard worker and knew what I wanted out of life from a young age. I am now in the police and adore my career, its what I've always wanted.

My boyfriend is an entirely different kettle of fish. He has 0 GCSEs, no college qualifications and has only managed to hold down one job his entire life (for 8 months) and left because he didn't get on with his boss, I wasn't with him at the time of this job. Since then, he has gotten no job offers and turned down the ONE job offer he got because ""he didn't like the sound of it.""

I have cut him so much slack with this job situation. He was raised in an awful household, he was consistently moved from house to house depending on what boyfriend his alcoholic mother had at the time, these boyfriends commonly abused my boyfriend and his mother. I assumed this would've jeopardized any education around 12-16 years of age. However- no job in almost 1 year? He now lives with his grandmother, claims universal credit and spends it all on tattoos or cigarettes, turns down anything the jobcentre offers him; and at the cost of sounding cruel, he lives in a pigsty. Last time I visited his house I ended up covered in bed bug bites, had to bath in dead flies (there was rotten food in the bathroom bin) and the kitchen was full of mouldy, dirty cups and plates. **He ""cannot be bothered to clean mess"" even though he does NOTHING all day but sit at his PC and play videogames.**

I have offered to help him get into therapy but he insists he doesn't have a poor mental state, I wrote his CV, I referred him to some of my family members as some of them own businesses, I suggested attending college again and wrote a personal statement for him to send to local colleges. I have tried EVERYTHING and to no avail.

I am moving out very soon as I have found a lovely rented property in my area, but I can't let my boyfriend live with me because I am too scared he will not find a sustainable job and will eventually lean on my income.

My family do not like him anymore. I come from a fairly well off background and they just view him as a lazy mess who wont pull his weight as an adult. However I do love this man. He almost worships the ground I walk on and he is amazing to be around, but at this point his affection is not enough to keep me in the loop.

I am so lost on this and I am starting to think he is almost convinced he will never work in his life. I don't know what to do.

TLDR; My boyfriend wont get a job, I am moving out soon/he wants to move in with me and I wont let him as he will leech off my income. This is ruining our relationship due to his laziness. 


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10oi5pn/update_my_21m_boyfriend_refuses_to_get_a_job_and/)  (30 Jan 23)


**[UPDATE] My (21M) boyfriend refuses to get a job and it is ruining our relationship (19F)**

Hi all, sorry for the delay on an update I've been on very long shifts with work so it completely skipped my mind. (previous post on my profile if you haven't seen it)

I went round to his house on saturday after I had a brief break from work and said to him I was ending  the relationship because of his lack of ambition and laziness. As guessed he broke down into tears and promised he'd try harder and sign onto other agencies that would help him, do better, work on cleanliness etc. I told him I'd waited long enough and tried to help him but he refused to take it and hopefully me leaving will give him a bigger push to do better and do well for himself.

THEN came the self harm threats. I asked to leave as awhile had passed and I had said what I wanted to say and he claimed he was already self harming from the way his life was and me leaving will push him over the edge. I said I still cared about him but I couldn't help with that and he followed me to my car and I drove off. I was worried he was sincere in what he said so I rang emergency services for a welfare check, I also blocked him on everything to stop him from potentially spam calling me.

That's the end of that chapter, it does suck but I knew I needed better. Also means I don't have to worry about moving into my own place with someone leeching off my wages.

Thank you to all the strangers here for the advice, I appreciate it a lot : )

[**ORIGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vhwd4/i42f_am_having_issues_with_my_sil_44f_recently_it/) \- 11th February 2015

I really need some help dealing with a tricky family situation. It has been building and came to a head last Friday. I really don't like to talk about money, but this issue centers on it and so there is no choice. I also feel I need to give some background for this to make enough sense to garner some solid advice. I'll give as much detail as I can while trying to still keep it vague there are a lot of people involved. I'm sorry it is so long.

I grew up pretty solidly middle class and my husband Jay (48m) grew up working poor. My father spent 20 years in the military then 30 years with a union and my mother was a SAHM - neither attended college. It was very important to my parents that both my brother and I attend college. My brother Mark (48m) ended up attending a service academy, so no tuition. I ended up with enough scholarship money to make my own full ride at a private university. Our parents gifted us the money they would have put towards our tuition upon our respective graduations. My husband worked his butt off to get through undergrad, grad and an MBA all while working full time and sometimes supporting family members. He and I are coming up on our 18th wedding anniversary this summer. He is an executive and I worked at a nonprofit for 5 years before becoming a SAHM. My life revolves around our 4 children, though I still find plenty of time for volunteer work. We are incredibly lucky. Live a very charmed life and we don't take it for granted, at least I hope.

My husband has a large family. His mother (66f) Dee, one younger brother Tim (46m) and sister Leigh (45f) live in the same area we do and we see them the most frequently of his relatives. My parents and my brother and his family live near us as well. We are all very close and spend a lot of time together including vacations. My parents are retired. My brother spent 20 in the military and then went into a second well paying career, his wife Jess (45f), also retired military, is a hospital administrator. Leigh and her wife Amy (39f) own a very successful salon/day spa. Tim is a deputy sheriff. He is also a widower who remarried Emily (44f) four years ago and navigating her feelings is what I need help with.

Emily came into our lives suddenly. It had been about 10 months since Tim's wife had passed away. She showed up at Leigh's salon and said Tim ""sent her"" to get ""dolled up"". A couple weeks after that Tim started bringing her to family events. I felt bad for Emily. No one liked her and it was palpable. Five weeks later she announced she was pregnant at Tim's daughter's first communion. In front of his deceased wife's parents. She told everyone she was on the pill and it must have failed. No one really believed her. Tim married her two weeks later in Las Vegas.

When they opened our gift Tim flipped out with happiness and her face fell. She looked incredulous and said she thought we would get them a house. We had given them a trip to Hawaii for their honeymoon, since Vegas was going to serve as their honeymoon too, we thought this would be a nice treat. We would be caring for our nieces and even offered to take Emily's children or hire childcare. My husband said, rather calmly to his credit, that the trip could be used towards a down payment instead. She clicked her tongue and said ""What a nice gift a mortgage and no honeymoon, welcome to the family!"" She was positively glaring at me. Before anyone could say anything else my husband took my hand and we left. Later, when they got back from Hawaii, she apologized, saying that since we had bought townhomes for both our parents, she assumed we'd gift them a house too. ""For our children and you know so they can all be near the family in a nice safe gated community."" She has 5 children and Tim has 3 and then they have 1 together.

Its been a passive aggressive spiral since then and she seems to target me the most. Look, we have money. I have expensive bags and shoes and all those totally unnecessary, but fantastic things wealthy housewives can collect. Every time its ""Oh, a chanel bag, must be nice, but I'd rather my children have nice clothes."" Or she'll put her foot up next to my foot and say ""8000 or 19.95, I can't tell the difference can any of you?"" and she'll laugh and laugh like it's an inside joke. BTW I DO NOT own 8000$ shoes. The other women in my family have the same or similar priced things, mine seem to anger Emily the most.

Hosting holidays and celebrations rotates between myself, Jess and Leigh. Thanksgiving is my holiday. For the past four years she has done something to mess it up. Year one she accidentally broke a crystal punch bowl that had been a gift to my great grandmother on her wedding day. I was devastated, but was a gracious hostess and actually believed it was an accident. Later my cousin said the only way it could have broken the way it had was for someone to pick it up and drop it straight down. It was full of red drink and made a mess, ruining some linens too. Year two our powder room overflowed. She admitted she had done that as a ""fun family prank that had gone wrong, we always prank each other!"" we do not. Year three my gravy was so salty it was inedible. I'm blaming it on her. She kept asking ""Oh where is your giblet gravy, I just LOVE your gravy"" and on and on. This past year was the worst. Amy pulled me aside and showed me a bottle of ipecac. She said she saw Emily pull it out of her purse, then pop it in real quick again when Amy walked in. Amy took it after Emily walked out. I was so panicked she might have used it already, but it was sealed. Amy and I decided not to say anything right then. Later, Emily came out from where the coats and purses were looking flush and she kept looking at Amy and looking away. I told my husband later that night and he was furious and called his brother. They had a terrible fight and have barely spoken since.

I know this is so long, but there is one more thing that happened that really put this over the top. My brother and Jess host a Super Bowl Sunday Party. They go all out. My brother not only invites our family his friends and co-workers, but also work friends of just about everyone in our family. Emily decided she wanted to host Super Bowl. She sent out invites to everyone in the family. Everyone said they would be attending Jess &amp; Mark's party. She sent out reminders stating that it was time for someone else to be allowed to host an event and that this year was their year to host super bowl. This was the fair thing to do and she expected everyone there with a snack at 3pm BYOB. Needless to say no one showed. About an hour into the game Tim even showed up at my brothers to watch the game. I kept expecting angry calls and texts, yet heard nothing. The following Friday it all blew up.

My children attend parochial school and I am a room mom so I attend mass on Fridays with them. While this is technically a public weekday mass its a church attached to a school so all of the children are there. I was standing in the side aisle helping my class when she walks up, grabs my arm and says we need to talk. Everyone turned their heads as she didn't bother to keep her voice down. Luckily we were near a side door and we got outside before she blew up. She started screaming at me about how I ruined her life. How my jealousy of her kept her from becoming a part of the family. How I was just a pretty mean girl that never left my sorority but sooner or later, my ass would fall and my face would rot. How she was sorry that her ""hot dogs and chips weren't good enough for me and I just couldn't miss out on my super bowl porterhouse..."" it was then one of our deacons walked out and I wished I could have evaporated. How ridiculous. He told us they could hear us inside. I started to apologize, she screamed ""I don't fucking care, pedophile!"" I told her I was done and to not come to my children's school ever again. Our deacon was already pulling out his cell phone. He said to her to leave or he'd call the police. She yelled at him, her husband was ""the police but she guessed he only cared about women who married walking wallets like (I) did."" He started to laugh. I don't blame him, it was so absurd. I tried not to but I giggled too. I looked at her shaking my head and said ""Emily..."" She slapped me across the face, spit at me and walked away. I've never been so shocked. I've never been hit in my life. She left a bruise on my arm where she held on to it. She also keyed my car all up. Everyone wanted to call the police, but I asked them not to. To please let us handle this family situation. I was so embarrassed. My husband is FURIOUS. His brother came over and apologized to us both profusely. He said he would pay for my car. I wouldn't hear of it though my husband looked tempted. The whole family knows and has taken my ""side"" which I think makes it worse, however I am grateful for the sentiment. The whole parish knows. It was comforting Sunday to hear story after story of ""crazy"" in laws, but I want to fix this. How? How do I fix this with her?

tl;dr: SIL is upset at the wealth gap in our family and its making every gathering and everyone extremely uncomfortable. I want to fix this, how?

 

[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2vmbqo/update_i42f_am_having_issues_with_my_sil_44f/) \- 12th February 2015

I want to thank everyone for all of their kind comments and their advice. It has been a very long stressful day and while this saga is not over I do want to update you all. Again thank you it means so much to me the way you have helped. Just listening was enough and you all went above and beyond.

Going to try to keep this short and to the point. The other post was so long and I actually edited out three stories that made that first part make sense, but it was very cathartic for me.

Day started with a family meeting at my husbands office. His mom, brother, sister and my brother. Tim, honestly he was relieved. He said he'd been ready to divorce her since the thanksgiving incident, but he said he was so embarrassed for what he had gotten himself and his three girls into. His girls are 7/9/12. My husband and his brother and my brother were on one end of the spectrum. Wanted full prosecution etc. Amy and I were the other. Lets just cut her out. Everyone else was in between. Finally decided we would file a police report, get restraining orders. Get a few more cameras for home. Tim would file for divorce and custody of their shared daughter Diane. They would stay with us for a while, then the plan was for all of them to move to a new home with Tim's mom.

We all split up my husband and I went to our attorney. Then to our church. With plans to go to the police station after. When the administrator at our diocese found out vandalism and assault had taken place on church property and authorities had not been called he was furious. So the authorities were called. Long story a bit shorter. Report filed. Temporary protective orders. Long day. All good.

Not so fast. Tim had gone home to get the girl's things and to arrange a personal leave. Emily was there. She knew something was up and I guess it was pretty ugly. She said a lot of horrible things about Beth and Beth's children apparently. Broke a lot of things and took off after saying he could have his divorce and get this his whole ""crazy family"". Seriously I could laugh over this if it wasn't so heartbreaking. Tim went to pull the girls from school when he got back his german shepherd was gone.

My brother's wife had my children for the afternoon. My husband, brother and I are just leaving our attorney for the second time and we get a call from our community security that there has been some vandalization. My heart sank. We get home. My bare root roses are torn up and there is feces smeared all over our door. I didn't go into what was keyed into my car, but she had keyed ""cunt"", ""fucker you"" (yes, fucker you), ""beaner"" and ""wet back"" into it and what looked like a penis. Now I'm of cuban heritage so the word she was looking for was ""balsero"" but it was a close enough insult. She wrote ""cunt"", ""beaner"" and ""jay fucked me"" in her feces on my porch. I will say it was at this point I stopped worrying about her feelings.

Police were called. My brother Mark called two of his out of work vet buddies who are now employed as our security for the foreseeable future. Now we find out from Tim that Jax (the doggie) is missing.

Emily calls him and says she will kill herself and Jax if he doesn't bring Diane to her. Tim went to meet her with the police. Jax has broken ribs and a broken leg but he also bit her up pretty badly. Apparently she just started sobbing when they took her into custody.

So we all end up at Leigh and Amy's house and this is so heartbreaking. Karen, Tim's 12yo, broke down and said she was so happy Emily was gone. She admitted that Emily would spank her and her sisters and say mean things about their ""fat frumpy mother"" and they should be grateful god gave them such a ""cool pretty step mom"". After all the children got to bed Amy told us all she was a target of Emily too. Thats why she was suspicious of her. Emily was incredulous that Amy could be a lesbian and look so feminine. So she would always point out men and make crude statements and even make dating profiles for her and try to set her up on dates. She once held her against the wall and kissed her and when Amy pushed her away she said ""See I knew you weren't a dyke.""

As for Emilys children they are 16, 15, (second husband) 11, 9, (boyfriend) 7 (fourth husband). 16, 15 &amp; 7 are with their fathers. 11 &amp; 9 are with child welfare. Tim wants to get custody of them their father has not been in the picture for a very long time.

There is a lot more detail but I'm just mentally and emotionally exhausted. We are taking all the children away for the weekend. Therapy for everyone. I'm just hoping we can get this all resolved as smoothly as possible. This is hands down the most insane most traumatic most honestly asinine thing I have ever gone through and it's still ongoing. I'm grateful I've been able to talk about it here and I hope I can keep updating because it is really helpful to me to hear outside perspective.

tl;dr Emily is on a hold and treat. Tim and his children are staying with us for a while. Amy was being tormented as well. There were temporary protective orders issued all around. There are two pretty bad things that happen here. You may want to brace yourself one involves a pet, the other feces.

 

**Additional Info from comments -**

&gt;Hi. This might be a little upsetting for animal lovers. I can barely think about it without getting pretty worked up. Jax is getting up into senior age he is 8. I don't know every detail of what happened when she was taken into custody but she hit Jax in the head with a car jack, this just caused a gash that needed some stitches, and when he started biting her she started beating on his body. Probably more so to get him off her. Now as Tim and then the police rushed up Tim did say Jax jumped out of the suv and he thinks that may have been when he broke his leg. Its not a bad break but he will need some physical therapy because shepherds can have hip issues especially as they age.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also I edited out a couple of things from my first post because it had gotten so long. Like she became enraged that my brother offered to help her oldest son through the steps to get a nomination to a service academy. He had mentioned joining the military. She just expect all her children to get college funds and said some hurtful things like ""oh well that will cost you nothing"" and ""doesn't matter if my son gets killed but your golden child (referring to my oldest) will be going to harvard!""  
&gt;  
&gt;Also I am pretty embarrassed by this and hoping it gets buried but since I did edit it out before and in the spirit of full disclosure... she borrowed from me all the time. Also Amy and some from Jess and Tim's mom Dee. Shoes, purses, clothing, jewelry. I let her. I am a push over who felt sorry for her and yes, guilt at my own good fortune. Well come to find out she'd been selling most of it and then buying what she wanted. Her excuse was that I could buy more. Yea. Thats Emily. And Yea I do feel like a bit of an idiot.

Trigger Warning: &gt;!Drug use and violence!&lt;.

[First Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55c4q6/my_36m_family_wants_to_reconcile_with_me_after/?st=iujefify&amp;sh=48a22fd5)\- October 1st 2016.

 I was a pretty terrible addict between 16 and 22. I caused my family a great deal of pain and embarrassment during those years. I stole from them, frequently had episodes, and soiled their reputation. Two failed rehab attempts. The final straw was when I accidentally broke my younger brother's nose in a intoxicated state when I was 21. They kicked me out and barred me from further contact.

A year later, I was hospitalized after a dealer stabbed me. While I laid in bed for hours, I thought about all that I had done wrong, and vowed that I would quit. I thought I will collapse in the first month, but I have managed fourteen years so far.

I got a GED and took a low-wage job so I could pay back the money I stole. I sent the money in envelopes along with an apology and an address and phone number. No response. I tried again when I was 24 thinking enough time had passed. That time, they responded outright by writing that they were glad I had paid them back, but that they didn't love me anymore, that their lives were better without me regardless what I did, and an order that I never contact again.

I was shocked. It stung badly and I even thought of relapse out of spite, but my support group convinced me I needed to accept they were simply gone. I did community college for two years, transferred to a university, and now work at my sober companion's landscaping business. I meet my SO when I was 31, and we're engaged and expecting a boy in January.

My SO convinced me a year ago I should launch a Facebook page despite my original distaste for social media. I was surprised when my brother sent me a friend request a few weeks ago. Confused, I neither accepted or refused. He then sent me a message saying he had forgiven me about his nose and hoped we could reconnect. Cousins and my sister sent similar messages shortly after. Today, I got a letter from my parents saying they had been too harsh in our last contact and inviting me for dinner on Sunday.

I shared this with my SO, and she begging me that I should at least hear them out. She believes in second chances. But I gave them two chances already and they scorned me. Their motive is somewhat unclear. They can't know about SO or my unborn son because my posts on them are private. They also apparently decided together I should be forgiven. But whatever the case, I feel they waited way too long for reconciliation.

Is my SO right or should I ignore them?

tl;dr: Family wants forgiveness after disowning me for almost a decade and a half. SO thinks I should take their olive branch, but I don't think so.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/58lyto/update_my_36m_family_wants_to_reconcile_with_me/)\- October 21st 2016

 I didn't show up to the dinner that I was invited to. I did accept my brothers friends request, though, largely out of guilt over his nose, although there's also that fact I was fairly close to him when I was younger. Apparently I have a sister-in-law and a niece, and he seems to be doing well for himself. He deserves all he has. We'll be meeting in person over the weekend for the first time in ages.

I asked him why he contacted me at all. He claims to have tried finding me on Facebook for about three years, and mentioned finding me to our family after he did so. This apparently made them all decide that enough time had passed so they followed his lead.

I'm very glad I've made up with my brother, but I'm not really interested in reconnecting with the rest of them. It's been too long and at best we might be cordial strangers, which is worst than no contact. Any past love is gone and can't be brought back. So I'm not going to even try. SO and my brother have tried to convince me otherwise, but my mind is set up at this point.

tl:dr: Reconciled with brother, but have no interest in reconnecting with the rest of my family.

 April 22, 2022


TLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now theyre gonna sue me.


[edited to fix spelling / grammar / weird ass sentences I used]


My 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so its been difficult to deal with. Im in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. Shed be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She wouldve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first.


When she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had a generous amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I did not know that she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired. She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She left nothing to my parents but as they didnt know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and Im very low contact. We are their only two children.


At the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them Id continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didnt know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them Id be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them its my home and it was willed to me. They couldnt sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time.


Cue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now were preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this.


Just some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.


edit: I didnt expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. Ive gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. Its fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, Ill be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so Ill be continuing her business too and Ill need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I dont know its overwhelming.


edit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didnt know theyd even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesnt say anything about them but Im leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.


Final Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but wont push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and Ill give an official update at some point.


_Relevant comments_ 

ShadowMaven commented 

_It sounds like they fucked up since you parents dont seem to understand the estate and will process. If it was theirs they would have been contacted._ 

_The estate should have paid for the funeral and not them though._


_OOP replied_ 

_The funeral planner tried to say that but my parents interrupted our daughter will want us to pay for everything because we are her parents, thats what parents do. I was thinking of refunding them at minimum cost of funeral services_ 

stay_zooted commented 

_Make sure you get the title put in your name asap. Depending on where you live, they might require you to go through probate regardless and that is certainly something youd rather do sooner than later. If you ever try to sell or refinance the house, itll be a huge headache for you then and will probably cost you a lot more (in extended processing times, if not additional lawyer fees)._ 

_Source; I work in mortgages and this is not entirely uncommon._ 

_OOP replied_ 

_The deed was put into my name 3 or 4 weeks ago. It took a pretty long time so it mightve already gone through something. The lawyer said they had to do a search to make sure she didnt have debt and if she did they would pay that first then the funeral then I would be able to get the assets. Sister was pretty much debt free (she had a 200$ hospital bill) but yeah, after that lawyer called me up to sign a bunch of stuff and thats when my name was put on the deed(s) and they transferred the cars title to my name._ 

_Everyone is telling me to sell her rental investments, Im assuming thats a bad idea then?_

TLDR; wasnt able to get extensions for classes but they will allow me to withdraw, dad said he wont challenge will but says mom is still gonna. Itll take time for her to prepare a lawsuit and we are gathering evidence of sisters no contact and wishes. Sisters best friend Amy (fake name) is stepping in to help too.


My father stated he will not challenge the will but warned us mother is still going to try. He said (to attorney, not me) that despite his efforts to convince her she is saying mental health issues will prevent tifuwhyyyymeee from doing what needs to be done. My sisters best friend Amy was looped in since mother would be challenging the will, which she is apart of. Shes been amazing and Im very happy shes around. She used to live with sister &amp; I but left when she died (not because I wanted her to, she said it was hard being in our home) but she decided to come back after all of this!! I told my attorney since my sis had money set aside for a funeral anyway, I should offer to at minimum pay them back. They (Amy &amp; Attorney) both agreed itd be a good idea so my parents wont have a leg to stand on in court. Attorney has another meeting scheduled with my father on Friday / Monday depending on his availability. Things are going fast, and I didnt expect them to go this fast. Its like my head is spinning.


As for school, had a meeting with the dean and my academic advisor. Finals are next week so they thankfully moved it up. I explained the situation to them and they were apologetic and let me know theyd talk to me teachers. The dean got back to me today and said the teacher(s) were unwilling to compromise and ultimately it was up to them. He suggested I get the withdrawal for the classes so Ill drop those classes. Im taking a semester break as a lot of you suggested. Oh and for the Reddit user who said to offer free housing for the first year as a scholarship, Amy thought it would be a great way to honour my sister. Not sure the process for that but Amy said shed help me figure it out once Im out of school. Im happy Amy is back at home. Doesnt feel quite as empty as it did before.


Ill update again if theres any other developments but for now, Im gonna log out and let my attorney handle this. Thank you everyone for the advice.


_Relevant comments_ 

Inevitable_Water4478 commented 

_Dont let them bully you in paying anything until you consult your lawyer. I would also keep low contact with them and even look into the gray rock method. Your parents truly sound like they only care about money and not the actual person. No parent would say under their breath they wanted to sue their only surviving child because they think theyre entitled to the estate when they didnt. Those are people you dont want in your life often. Speaking from experience. If they continue to push you to sell the house, I would stop contacting them._ 

_OOP replied_ 

_I have already sent the check for reimbursement of the funeral / wake (celebration of life)_ 

_They wont be getting another dime from me_ 

Another comment from OOP 

_I do have an estate attorney but the attorney I was talking about was the one who helped create her will. He practices family law and litigation as well. He is a family friend of Amys so I trust him. I also have a real estate attorney because we had to draw up new leases for the tenants._ 

_P.s for anyone reading, I will not be changing the rent as some people feared. I think housing prices are absolutely absurd and as long as they remain the good renters my sister documented them as being, I dont see an issue with them paying under the market rate. It seems wrong to surcharge +800$/month when people honestly cannot afford it._


[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/user/TIFUwhyyyyyyymeeeeee/comments/vpcn1i/we_settled_it_during_mediation_kinda/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)   July 1, 2022


I wanted to keep it mostly vague but update you all. We settled prior to court for an undisclosed amount. She agreed to drop some things (example: slander) if I agreed to drop some things (example: emotional distress) Side note: those are just examples and most definitely not the things we discussed.


We both came to the agreement that I could post whatever tf I want. Dad pushed the whole freedom of speech stuff. I said I wouldnt let her take a dime from me but honestly i was just too exhausted from it. I cant go into much detail but I may make a new account and start posting all the shit my mother has put me through since everyone (by everyone I mean my parents >.) knows about this one now. Amy is still being a kickass mama bear and I was looking into adult adoption or at minimum changing my last name to hers. I want no ties to my parents.


Anyway, thanks for the support and love. P.s yes my father has been refunded for anything funeral related

&gt;I guess the level of enjoyment you get out of Hogwarts Legacy depends on your knowledge of the Harry Potter universe. The more you love this world the more youll enjoy Hogwarts Legacy. Its as simple as that. This doesnt mean that theres nothing here for those who are just getting started with Harry Potter or just want a fantasy world to explore - there certainly is - but Hogwarts Legacy truly feels like a love letter to the fans of J.K Rowlings work, above all.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is the game I've always dreamed of. I never thought you could do something like this with the Harry Potter saga. Avalanche has dared to create something new, but still being faithful to the original material. We are talking about one of those problematic games because not only do they overshadow everything that has been done with the franchise in the past, but because the next title will have a very difficult time reaching the bar that has set this one. Hogwarts Legacy is the game every Harry Potter fan deserved; a work for which I was not prepared.

&gt;While it doesn't do everything perfectly, Hogwarts Legacy stimulates the imagination with a rich world to explore and gameplay that empowers and thrills the player. The Harry Potter films had the tough task of taking words on a page and creating a visual language for them. Hogwarts Legacy had the even tougher task of taking that visual language and making it interactive, ultimately expanding it all into something that is fun to play and immerse yourself in. Although there's still a long year ahead of us and tons of great looking games on the horizon, Hogwarts Legacy is already one of the best games of 2023.

&gt;If you're already a Harry Potter fan, there will certainly be something for you at Hogwarts Legacy, even with a completely different range of characters from the one you're used to. The music, the different classrooms, the ghosts wandering around, the paintings on the walls, the poltergeist Peeves, it's all so nostalgic that, for a moment, I returned to my adolescence. If you're not entirely familiar with the Harry Potter lore, it'll be a little harder to understand some of the game's mechanics, but don't worry: you still have a huge world to explore, dozens of puzzles, collectibles and creatures to capture. Who knows, your journey into the world of sorcery begins here!

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a fully fleshed action RPG with everything that belongs to that. The fights are fun, the magic based riddles are nice, the presentation is beautiful, even if the game does not deliver a technically through and through next-gen experience. Don't think so much about the open world, think more about a magical atmosphere, that should reach any RPG player, in particular fans of the Harry Potter franchise.

&gt;Avalanche Software and Portkey Games have done an impressive job of creating something original within a much-loved franchise. Hogwarts Legacy is the closest any of us are ever going to get to actually attending Hogwarts, and what a magical experience it is. Its clear that its been created with love, and the attention to detail here is phenomenal. Its not without its issues, of course, but theres few that get in the way of the overall experience. It looks gorgeous, its a joy to play, and being a wizard is just about as fun as wed always hoped it would be.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is a solid first attempt. If Avalanche can be accused of anything, it's that the studio has tried to do too much all at once.

&gt;Expecto Verdictum! Hogwarts Legacy offers a serious mystery story that could quickly form the basis for another book in the Harry Potter world. It also often provides humorous situations that aren't just fan service. At the same time, it is not a fairy tale. The story isn't afraid to be morbid and doesn't hide the fact that the wizarding world is full of danger. The game manages to captivate as much as it disappoints but in a balanced way. It works well, thankfully, offering plenty of entertaining content that doesn't just act as filler between the main missions.

&gt;Pushing the J.K. Rowling controversy to the side, Hogwarts Legacy is a true celebration of the magical universe that she created which perfectly transitioned to film. Her universe has equally been adapted well into this game courtesy of Avalanche Studios with its gameplay and story. Whether the story will become canon is yet to be seen but again this is as close as you can get to the core of what the extended universe of Harry Potter can be that not only plays well on the PS5 but looks fantastic.

&gt;In terms of story, Hogwarts Legacy also manages to capture the magical feel of Harry Potter. It does it successfully by being set a good century before the events of the novels. We'll meet a few Weasleys, even a gaunt, to name a few. The only known characters from the other formats you'll know are the ghosts of Hogwarts, with you crossing with Peeves, chatting with Nearly-Headless Nick (if you're Gryffindor, I assume other houses will be different) and other longer-term fixtures. Fortunately, and as far as I am, the game manages to forge its path incredibly well, adding in a few canonical elements, such as ancient magic. I'm not at the end, so if it is canon, I'm curious how they explain away the lack of ancient magic in later stories.

Players are treated to an extensive story with a completely new cast of characters, a beautiful world full of content and a battle system that is strongly put together.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy is an absolutely magical video game, one that is packed with awe-inspiring moments full of mystery and wonderment. Come for Hogwarts itself, a magic school oozing with secrets to behold, and stay for the combat, the engaging story and the frankly astonishing Room of Requirement.

&gt;Hogwarts Legacy borrows a lot of design choices and ideas from other open-world titles, and yet, it creates a truly unique product, unlike any title in the genre, with a true focus on world-building rather than non-stop combat encounters. Its a game that should be experienced, even by those who arent Potter fans at all.

AUA!","Ever since ""The Last of Us"" premiered on HBO earlier this year, we've been bombarded with questions about Cordyceps fungi from our family members, friends, strangers, and even on job interviews! So we figured it would be helpful to do this AMA, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to dive into the biology of these microbes and explain how they wreck their special breed of havoc. Each of us studies a different host/parasite system, so we are excited to share our unique (but still overlapping) perspectives.

My Girlfriend Of 5 Years Wants To Explore Her Options


Me (22M) and my girlfriend (21 f) have been dating for around 5 years. We are both in college and started dating when she was 16 and I was 17. She was diagnosed with depression and used to talk to a lot of guys when we werent together . She liked tall and hairy guys and Im neither so this experience has brought back my insecurities when I was younger.


She recently told me guys were hitting on her in her workplace and that she liked the attention a couple of months before this (didnt exactly say that but it was something along the lines of that) so I gave her even more attention and tried to please her in that area.


She just told me that she wants to explore her options since shes still young . She told me something along the lines of shes unsure if shes gonna regret not exploring her options and how she feels trapped asked me how I know Im not going to regret it either .


 I thought our relationship was going great I communicate with her during sex, ask how shes doing and how I can improve myself and our relationship . Shes smiled with me, laughed with me,we went out to so many places together that we both picked out, we shop, we have passionate kisses,we have inside jokes, and even though shes not perfect I still work it out with her because in my mind theirs no one Id rather be with. God we had so many anniversaries we gave each other presents every holiday or special occasion . Ive been with her through the lowest of lows .It feels like everything weve had together  was just a lie , so she could stop being lonely but I hope thats not the case.


 Ive been running and jogging outside for 2 hours .As of typing this Im in my backyard laying on the grass listening to  THATS ALL I GOT by justice xavier, looking at the sky wondering what I did wrong . Im crying not knowing if Im worth loving anymore. Im angry because I feel so pathetic and worthless . It literally felt like someone stabbed me though the heart . 


Should I let her go explore her options(whatever that means)? Should I fight for our relationship? Should I let her know how I feel? Im so lost


TLDR; My girlfriend of 5 years wants to explore her options after feeling trapped . Should I fight for our relationship or should I let her go?


&gt;Sweetie, I'm so sorry you are sad right now. Give you both a break. Let her go. You will be sad. It's going to suck. But people come into our lives to teach us things. Sometimes they stay. Sometimes, they don't. She was your first serious girlfriend. Take the things you liked and build from there. Be open to what the universe has in store for you. You have the chance to level up. Meet new friends. Explore different hobbies. Travel. Save some money and pay down debt. Finish school. Get your career started. Maybe go to graduate school. The world is yours. Good luck >


OP: This is probably one of the best pieces of advice here thank you Ill do my best like I always do kind stranger >



Were taking a break for 5 weeks no contact . Who knows I might move on by that time but rn Im healing and worrying about myself . I refuse to be some little puppy waiting for her if she does something drastic im gone thank you for your advice


[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/10y1hib/update_my_girlfriend_of_5_years_wants_to_explore/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_buttonUPDATE: My Girlfriend Of 5 Years Wants To Explore Her Options


**UPDATE**: 


**GUIDE TO BREAKUPS AT THE END IF YOU WANT**


Okay want to preface by saying . I dont think its her fault . I dont TOTALLY believe it was my fault either though. I didnt do anything inherently wrong maybe I just wasnt in a good mental state because of stuff going on in my life . She had her issues too but who doesnt . I didnt abuse her or anything maybe I was just mopey and depressed or maybe we were just too young .


 Anyways,


She cheated on me and went on a date with a male coworker of hers 3 times . 


Its been around 2 months since we broke up.


 I gave her a second chance after she cheated but basically  I asked if she could be loyal to me and she said no. Im not going to lie to you it was DEVASTATING. Like I didnt know how much of my life revolved around her until we broke up . I think I was dependent on her and that was one of the many reasons why it didnt work out . 


I may have said some things I regret like telling her like Id miss her and PARAGRAPHS on how I respect her wishes and wish her well and how I love her blah blah blah . But I wanted to write this when I was in a good state of mind . 


Man I remember coming home after the breakup and just BREAKING . Like I saw my mom, put on the strongest poker face I could muster, and she asked what was wrong and I couldnt hold it in and just broke down. I cried like a MOTHEFUCKER and me and my mom had a heart to heart moment and just talked for HOURS . Most of it wasnt even about the ex which was nice . But that was my first step to getting better. Fast forward a little bit I start googling how to deal with a breakup since this is my first relationship which I had poured so much time and energy into and a great tip was to talk to my friends.


Man I was so stupid . I finally realize after 20 years of living  I can actually talk to people about my problems. Sounds so obvious but for some reason I NEVER ask for help. Not for school not at work and certainly not in life. So I start talking to my best friend of like 15 years about it( if youre reading this I love you man) and he was such a great help. He gave me advice and just talking about it made me feel better . TALK TO  YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS MAN OPEN UP. Asking for help isn't giving up, its refu
sing to give up.

Anyways I start making new friends and being more social especially at work. I met this new girl at work and I realized something . Im sweating. Not because I like her but because I ran out of new topics QUICK . And this was weird to me because Im usually the funny guy in social groups but its been a while I guess and I thought to myself &. Holy shit &. I have no idea how to communicate &. I have no personality . That was hard to admit .


I dont have feelings for said girl but she is literally my guardian angel. I have never felt more comfortable with a person . Shes so easy to talk to and weve gone through similar life events even the ex part . She even put me on One piece ( amazing show by the way). Shes literally like a more mature wiser slightly older version of me in a way thats  almost scary. Its crazy how similar we are  . Ill never forget when she asked What's wrong? and I responded with nothing and then she looked me dead in the eye and asked ""No really. What's wrong.I love her (not romantically) and Ill always be grateful for her being introduced into my life at probably one of my low points.


So anyway I start working out fixing my diet dressing better and learning how to be more confident and Ive noticed Ive gotten tons of compliments . Ive gotten called cute TWICE and pretty once . Ive gotten my outfit AND cologne complimented. The recognition ,for me, was strange because of me being insecure for such a long time. Ngl kinda boosted my confidence by a bit. And I started reconnecting with my old friends and, they say Im buff now ??? Idk for some reason I don't believe them cause I got a lot more fat to burn off but Im working almost everyday to being better than I was yesterday 


Ive studied philosophy and started to listen to new music and enjoy going out by myself to the city and just enjoying the calm and the quietness of it all. And I also started picking up new hobbies and going back to school. Ive started to play the guitar and maybe want to start creating content or maybe even photography.


Oh, and this other cute girl at work started flirting with me. She listens to the same bands and musicians  I do, SHE asked me for MY number, and we text a lot. She sends me some pretty funny stuff that is slightly flirtatious? She made a comment that I got muscles and started doing these slightly flirtatious playfighting things and she's called me cute before.  Oh, and this one time I showed up to my workplace just to say hey and when I tell you she LIT UP when she saw me & man & I havent seen anyone so happy to see me in such a long time. This was like a week ago and I still think about it. Makes my heart melt. I think its too soon to start a relationship and I still want to work on myself but shes tempting me for sure .


So yeah


Im doing good . Doing way better then I have been these last 2 years to be honest . I feel like Im starting to understand who I really am and how far Im willing to push my limits . Im confident strong smart passionate intense reliable and funny . And for the first time in a long time I dont need someone else to tell me that because I built that self-esteem on my own


If youre going through something similar I promise it gets better . Just dont give up and find ways to work on yourself while you heal. 


Fuck hating your ex. Forgive her, so you can move on and Just cut contact and spread love . Say hey to the people you walk by . Buy those shoes youve always wanted . Go hike that mountain solo . Compliment that cute girls outfit . Tell your friends theyre awesome . Say I love you to the people closest to you. Go to that hair salon and get a cool new haircut . Sing that song at the top of your lungs in the car . 


The world really is held together by the love and passion of a few people.

Changing your mentality:


Cant hurt me by David Goggins (Book)MUST READ

Nacho libre (funny movie but great message)


Kung fu Panda 1,2,3( Great messages hear me out )


What you should do (in my opinion)


Cut off all ties with your ex. Block them if you need to. Delete all photos and messages. Now is the time to stop caring about what shes doing and start being more selfish. Its tough but would you rather suffer by torturing yourself with having constant reminders of her, or, suffer by moving on and picking your goals and hobbies over her? You KNOW what has to be done. 


Oh and get a Gym membership. Jeffnippard (and maybe hamza for diet tips) on YouTube is your best friend. Helps clear your mind. The hard part isn't the workout. The hard part is showing [up. ](https://up.It)[It](https://up.It) gets easier.

**Goodbye? And Thank you!**


My life isnt the same anymore and Im unsure of who is going to show up next. But what I do know is that we have to be kind, especially when we dont know whats going on, were not here forever:)


I dont think Ill be using this account again. Maybe Ill stop by and say hello after I get married or something who knows :).

For some context: I (m19) was bullied ever since I came out (I'm gay) in 2018 by a group of boys. At the time I spoke with teachers and counsellors and my parents did as well but they did nothing to stop it. 

One of the guys who I'll call ""Tim"" was the worst. He would follow me around, calling me names and making sexual remarks like asking if I was the ""boy or the girl"" and stuff like that. Again, nobody said anything to him or any of the other guys. Which honestly I'm not even surprised now since that was a small town in a very conservative state. I was called into the principal's office once and he told me that I should stop complaining about my classmates because obviously they wouldn't hurt me or try to touch me inappropriately because they are straight. 

After graduation I went to a college that's out of state as I wanted to get as far as possible from my hometown. Unluckily for me, when the school year started some day I ran into Tim, he had chosen the same university.

He tried to become my friend for some time until I told him I didn't wanted him to be my friend and quite honestly didn't even wanted him to talk to me. We live in the same dorm and sometimes we run into each other, but I asked him to ignore me. A few months after he messaged me on Instagram and asked me to met up with him because he wanted to talk to me, I assumed he wanted to apologize for the bullying maybe but as I said, I didn't care for his apologies so I told him everything was ok between us but I really didn't wanted to talk to him. Ever since I started running into him more than before, I thought I was paranoid because this guy scares me a lot, but basically he confirmed it once. He told me he recently had realized that his sexuality wasn't what he always thought and he also realized that he was always ""playing"" with me because he actually liked me. I wanted to say something else to him, but as we were in a small place and alone I told him that was rough but I wasn't interested and he should look somewhere else. 

That happened like nine or ten months ago, and ever since he has been making my life hell again. He follows me around and I'm scared, I tried reporting him but since he lives in the same dorm as me I don't have enough proof to make them think that he's following me. I'm scared he might hurt me. And as nobody's believing me I exposed him on Instagram with some messages that he had sent me and some photos I took of him following me. Some of my old classmates follow me and the news about Tim being gay had spread on our hometown. I haven't seen him around lately.

A few days ago he messaged me and told me I ruined his life because now his family disowned him, along some other stuff. I feel bad because I know how hard it is to be queer in our hometown. I really didn't think about this before exposing him, I feel like an asshole.


Edit: thank you really for all of your comments, either judgement you left, because it has helped me gather up my thoughts a bit. I'm still trying to decide if I should keep pushing the school authorities to do something about him, I might wait a day or two before making anything because I don't want to regret it. I haven't seen this guy around lately, perhaps he's given up and everything has finally ended. I got a lot of thinking to do over this because I don't want to fuck things up now that things seem to have stopped. If there's any other important thing to add I'll make another edit.

2023-02-24,1677268482,"""Why don't you tell somebody who gives a shit bro"". Aight, then.","This happened back in the day with a teacher I used to work with who taught a class of adult students who took a very high stakes exam. This high stakes exam (unless you passed this you couldn't qualify for scholarships, some aspects of financial aid, etc.) was multiple choice, and I was part of the campus' proctoring  team. This particular teacher didn't like me very much, and I was fine with that. We had different personalities, and that's okay.

This was in important test.  This exam is an important piece of data that the ""Haricoma County Community College System"" (fictitious name) uses to compare it's success to sister schools across the county, and even across the state. It's not an ACT or SAT, but it's the Junior College version of a GRE, basically. It just happens to be administered in this particular course, which is required by all who attend that major in pretty much anything. Anyway, sorry that this detail was added late, I'm writing this as I""m remembering the details (I copied and pasted this from the bottom to this paragraph that it's in, so sorry if it seems choppy). 

So anyway, during the actual test it was my job to make sure the classroom was fully functional, math helps were covered up, etc. This included covering up the ""four quadrants"" that were labeled in the four corners. 

The teacher, we'll call Captain Cheat, was okay with *most* of my suggested (demanded) changes. Before the kids took the test I made sure we covered up the four quadrants, but Captain Cheat was determined to have the four letters in the four corners up still. They were literally framed ""posters"" with fancy decorated letters A, B, C, and D. I was like... ummmmm I don't see how this could help, but suuure. 

Anyway, the students started walking in, looking and the sparse walls, seemed panicked for a second, then relieved to see that there were still letters up. 

This was my first clue of weirdness, but should have really been my second. During the test, I saw the teacher walking around the room, looking at kids' answers. I noticed a *very* interesting pattern that, if you didn't pay attention, you would miss. No words were spoken. 

He would walk past a student. The student would look up at the teacher. The teacher would look away into the middle distance. The student would look at the same middle distance, then bubble in an answer. It was a little weird, but a very consistent pattern. 

I then payed a little closer attention, and saw that some students were better at hiding what the teacher was doing than others. Some kids didn't look where the teacher looked, they just knew what to bubble somehow. 

Then, it happened... a student took their pencil, pointed at a bubbled in letter, looked at the teacher... the teacher looked at me.... I looked away... and saw the teacher look intently at his picture at the corner of the room that said ""D"".  The kid then clearly changed their answer to D, even mouthing ""D"", kind of whispering it to themselves even. WOW. 

When testing was over, and every student handed in their scantron and left, I immediately approached the teacher, saying ""I can't believe you. Impressive but disappointing, you're literally cheating these students out of an education. You either have them retake this without your magic signs, or I go to the board"". 

He responds  


""Why don't you tell somebody who gives a shit?!. Hashtag Good Luck Proving it!!!"".

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, this dude cringingly said ""hashtag""

Enter Malicious Compliance... 

The first part of Captain Cheater's comment set me off, and at that point, honestly I wasn't probably going to go ham on this guy. This is 100 percent due to the additional cockified cringe-factor of saying ""hashtag"".  Maybe I'm just jealous because I""M supposed to be cocky-plus-cringe and he's killing my vibe, but either way... I will... I WILL tell somebody who give's a shot... the provost. The provost, indeed, gave a shit. 

A community College aside&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

This is a community college, which some people see as ""lesser than"", but I see community college as truly superior for the first two years of college courses. The requirements to teach are having a masters plus five years experience in the field they are teaching, and at the university you'd be in a class of 500 and never really hear from the actual professor. It's cheaper and higher quality education, pretty much across the board. It's a no-brainer. So those Community College haters out there... whatever. 

Aside over&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

So anyway I tell the provost, and Captain Cheat is not just brought before the board, but is put on administrative leave instantly. Like INSTANTLY. He wasn't sent away in handcuffs or anything, the stakes weren't THAT high, but this was an exam that affected a lot of peoples' money, and in turn lives.

This guy looked particularly pissed, more so than usual, and I know for a fact that he hasn't worked at the university level since (based on his LinkedIn that says he's working at a ""Jarget Warehouse"").

A Norfolk Southern freight train that derailed along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border on February 3 spewed millions of pounds of toxic materials into the environment, killing wildlife, pets, and forcing evacuations.

Five of the cars carried vinyl chloride, a potent carcinogen used in the production of plastic material. While this is bad enough in itself, in order to avoid a potential explosion emergency crews released the vinyl chloride from the tankers and set it aflame ([video](https://youtu.be/dA09r6oOR4M))turning the chemical into phosgene and hydrogen chloride. Phosgene is a colorless nonflammable gas so poisonous that it was used extensively as a [chemical weapon](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/a-brief-history-of-chemical-war) during World War I. 

&gt;Phosgene, which smells like moldy hay, is also an irritant but six times more deadly than chlorine gas. Phosgene is also a much stealthier weapon: its colorless, and soldiers did not at first know they had received a fatal dose. After a day or two, victims lungs would fill with fluid, and they would slowly suffocate in an agonizing death. Although the Germans were the first to use phosgene on the battlefield, it became the primary chemical weapon of the Allies. Phosgene was responsible for 85% of chemical-weapons fatalities during World War I.

* Other toxic chemicals released by the derailment [include](https://abcnews.go.com/US/toxic-chemicals-train-derailed-ohio-originally-reported-data/story?id=97080179) (1) ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, which causes irritation of the nose and throat, nervous system depression, headache, and vomiting; (2) ethylhexyl acrylate, a carcinogen that causes burning and irritation of the nose and throat, as well as shortness of breath and coughing; (3) isobutylene, which causes dizziness and drowsiness.

Governor Mike DeWine (R) ordered all residents within a one-mile radius to evacuate before the controlled release and burn. Three days later, the evacuation was [lifted](https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/u-s-epa-updates-on-east-palestine-train-derailment/) after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported air quality readings consistently showed readings at points below safety screening levels for contaminants of concern.

&gt;Around-the-clock testing inside and outside the evacuation zone around the village of East Palestine and a sliver of Pennsylvania showed the air had returned to normal levels that would have been seen before the derailment, [said](https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-ohio-climate-and-environment-business-evacuations-e7a9c9db57561fceb3224546c872fd58?taid=63e42c2905dea00001ee2d66&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter) James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

&gt;Hundreds and hundreds of data points weve collected over the time show the air quality is safe, he said.

###Local impacts

Despite the all-clear from authorities, residents are nervous to returnand rightfully so. Every American should remember that the lead contaminants in [Flints drinking water](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis) were detected almost immediately by residents, yet it took two years for officials to attempt to rectify the situation. During that time, authorities denied there was any threat to public health. Now, almost a decade later, virtually every official involved in the crisis has had their criminal charges [dropped](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/judge-dismisses-flint-water-crisis-charges-against-former-michigan-officials) or [dismissed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/us/flint-michigan-rick-snyder-water-crisis/index.html).

If officials are right about the overall air readings being safe to breathe, what about the air and surfaces inside residents houses? This is one [concern](https://apnews.com/article/evacuations-ohio-pennsylvania-climate-and-environment-9fc6adc154daa5b8245380b7067dc6d7) of people returning home, especially those with children:

&gt;Hours after being told she could go home for the first time since a train hauling chemicals derailed and later sent up a toxic plume near the Pennsylvania state line, Melissa Henry nervously walked inside her house.

&gt;First, she washed her sheets and pillow cases. Then she started throwing out everything left on her kitchen counters. She opened all of her windows too, hoping to air out whatever might have seeped inside while fearful of the air outside too.

&gt;Was that the right thing to do or not? You just dont know, she said Thursday. It was a nightmare, it still is.

Returning residents may also find their pets [sick or deceased](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/02/11/pzct-f11.html):

&gt;A certified foxkeeper just outside the evacuation zone has reported one of his foxes died after the burn. Out of nowhere, he just started coughing really hard, just shut down, and he had liquid diarrhea and just went very fast, Taylor Holzer told WKBN television based in Youngstown. He said all of his foxes have been sick and lethargic since the train derailment February 3. This is not a fox acts. He is very weak, limp. His eyes are very watery and weepy, Holzer said, adding that some of the foxes are pacing in their pens, a sign they are unwell.

&gt;Peoples cats are getting sick and dying, and peoples other birds that they have in their house that they werent being able to evacuate either. Its just, its not safe for them.

###Widespread impacts

Air pollution is the most obviously visible impact of the derailment and subsequent burn, but water pollution is just as dangerous. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimated that the release of toxic chemicals [killed](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/east-palestine-train-derailment/odnr-estimates-3-500-fish-killed-by-east-palestine-train-derailment-spill) thousands of fish across over 7 miles of streams in East Palestine. And, as we all know, water doesnt stay in one spot. The [Ohio River Basin](https://www.ohio.edu/orbcre/basin/index.html#:~:text=The%20Ohio%20River%20Basin%20is,Louisville%2C%20Indianapolis%2C%20and%20Nashville.)already [designated](https://www.wlwt.com/article/report-shows-ohio-river-leads-nation-in-toxic-pollutants/41561994) the most toxic watershed in the nation due to chemical and fossil fuel production across Appalachiastretches across 14 states and covers a region of about 204,000 square miles. While officials have touted the safe air quality levels, they have not been able to provide similar assurances for water quality:

&gt;Linda Murphy, who lives about three miles from the site of the train derailment, confirmed to News 5 last week that she saw dead fish floating in several locations on Leslie Run. She says her family isn't touching the well she uses for water on her property until they get assurances that it's safe.

&gt;Thats what we bathe in, that's what we drink, that's what we cook with and thats what I also give to my animals, so its a major concern and they could not reassure me the water was safe to drink. They didnt say it wasnt and absolutely refrained from saying that it was, Murphy said.

###Arresting reporters

Making things worse, Ohio police officers arrested a reporter broadcasting from Gov. DeWines press conference about the derailment, stoking rumors that the government is trying to somehow cover up the full extent of the disaster. NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was arrested on charges of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest after being told to keep quiet in the middle of a live report. [Body camera footage](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/newsnation-reporter-arrest-ohio-body-camera-video/index.html) shows National Guard adjutant general Maj. Gen. John Harris pushing Lambert before the reporter is placed on the ground, handcuffed, and removed from the building.

###Ignored warnings and corrupt companies

The disastrous derailment comes just weeks after the President and Congress shut down a potential national railroad strike, siding with rail companies over railway workers who warned of dangerous industry-wide [practices](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/11/ohio-train-derailment-wake-up-call). 

&gt;The Palestine wreck is the tip of the iceberg and a red flag, said [Ron Kaminkow, an Amtrak locomotive engineer and former Norfolk Southern freight engineer], who is secretary for the Railroad Workers United, a non-profit labor group that coordinates with the nations rail unions. If something is not done, then its going to get worse, and the next derailment could be cataclysmic.

The major rail companies have all drastically cut workers in recent years, part of an effort to slash costs and boost profits. Norfolk Southern, responsible for the Ohio derailment, let more than [3,500](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/railroads-are-slashing-workers-cheered-on-by-wall-street-to-stay-profitable-amid-trumps-trade-war/2020/01/02/dc757ed4-1603-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html) employees go in 2019 alone.

&gt;More than 20,000 rail workers have lost their jobs in the past year [2019], the biggest layoffs in rail since the Great Recession and a nearly 10 percent decline in rail employment, according to Labor Department data through November&The rail industry, which once employed more than a million Americans, fell below 200,000 employees in 2019, the first time that has happened since the Labor Department started keeping track of railroad employment in the 1940s&

&gt;We fundamentally changed the way we operate over the last 2½ years, said Bryan Tucker, vice president of communications at CSX. Its a different way of running a railroad.

&gt;A Norfolk Southern spokeswoman said the company was focused on increasing efficiency and profitable growth and that as our business changes, so too do our personnel needs. Union Pacific stressed the environmental benefits of moving goods by rail instead of truck.

While laying off thousands of workers, Norfolk Southern spent [billions](http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en/news/norfolk-southern-announces-new--10-billion-stock-repurchase-prog.html) on stock buybacks and [millions](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/ceo-pay-norfolk-southern-rises-842-million) on executive salary increases. 

The company simultaneously fought off both a [shareholder proposal](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2017/friendsfiduciary011717-14a8.pdf) to assess, review, and mitigate risks of hazardous material transportation and a [proposed](https://www.levernews.com/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/) federal regulation that would have tightened safety guidelines for trains carrying hazardous materials. 

&gt;The sequence of events began a decade ago in the wake of a major uptick in derailments of trains carrying crude oil and hazardous chemicals, including a New Jersey train crash that leaked the same toxic chemical as in Ohio.

&gt;In response, the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials. However, after industry pressure, the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials, including the chemical involved in this weekends disaster.

&gt;Then came 2017: After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns, the Trump administration  backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans  rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nations rails.

Rail company and chemical company lobbyists aggressively pushed back on safety regulations that could have potentially prevented the Norfolk Southern train from derailing in Ohio. Preliminary information, including video evidence, [suggests](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2023/02/10/east-palestine-train-derailment-video-fire-axle-alert/stories/202302100070) that the train traveled at least 20 miles with a malfunctioning axle. Shortly before the accident, the train crew had gotten an alert to the issue and started to apply the brakes, however, it can take over a mile for a train of that length to fully stop&unless it has Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.

Heres where the corruption and malfeasance enters the picture: Norfolk Southern and other rail companies successfully [lobbied](https://www.levernews.com/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/) against requiring ECP brakes on all trains, even those carrying hazardous chemicals:

&gt;Then came 2017: After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns, the Trump administration  backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans  rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nations rails.

&gt;Specifically, regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. Norfolk Southern had previously touted the new technology  known as Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes  for its potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60 percent over conventional air brake systems.

&gt;But the companys lobby group nonetheless pressed for the rules repeal, telling regulators that it would impose tremendous costs without providing offsetting safety benefits. [...]

&gt;Would ECP brakes have reduced the severity of this accident? Yes, Steven Ditmeyer, a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), told The Lever.

###Political donations

Finally, lets look at why railroad companies have been allowed to get away with a consistent pattern of over [1,700](https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/nationworld/how-often-do-trains-derail-more-often-than-you-think/#:~:text=While%20fatalities%20from%20train%20derailments,of%201%2C704%20derailments%20per%20year.) train derailments per year. The answer is political money. In 2022 alone, Norfolk Southern made [$1,332,689](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/norfolk-southern/summary?toprecipcycle=2022&amp;contribcycle=2022&amp;lobcycle=2022&amp;outspendcycle=2022&amp;id=D000019639&amp;topnumcycle=2022) in contributions and spent $1.8 billion in lobbying lawmakers and regulators. The entire rail industry donated [$3.7 million](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/freight-rail-pacs-contribute-to-republicans-and-democrats) to politicians in 2020, the majority going to Republican candidates.

*In contrast, Norfolk Southern (worth $55 billion) is [giving](https://www.yahoo.com/now/norfolk-southern-giving-25-000-200000640.html) East Palestine just $25,000 to clean up the town they polluted.*

The political money isnt likely to slow down, as rail companies seek to expand their network. Days after the Ohio derailment, Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern proposed a $27 billion merger that would increase the transport of hazardous material like fossil fuels across America. According to an environmental impact [statement](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/13/canadian-pacific-kansas-city-southern-merger-tar-sands-texas), a total of nearly 13 releases of hazardous materials could occur every year along any point of the rail line.

&gt;If it goes through, it would create the first direct route from Canadas bitumen oil sands mines in Alberta to heavy crude refineries in Port Arthur, an industrial city on the Texas coast. We fully expect that the combination of the two railroads will only strengthen their support for this new source of bitumen, the vice-president of USD Group, a Texas-based midstream company, told a Canadian newspaper last year.

&gt;Local environmentalists say the increase in fossil fuel refining along the Gulf coast will impact their health  and increase carbon emissions. It also could put residents like Williams at risk of a hazardous oil spill. I live close enough to the track that if there is a derailment, and there is hazardous materials, its going to impact me directly, she said. Not to mention all of the hundreds of other residents that these lines are on  its pretty alarming.","Keep_Track",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/112az2x/rail_companies_fought_against_safety_measures/"

**Friendly Introduction**

Ah, The Sims, the virtual dollhouse game franchise that has no competitors and keeps churning out content and drama with no end in sight. The game where for over two decades people have been murdering their Sims by drowning or starving them. You know the one.

The Sims 4 drama often revolves around the release of new packs with broken or unsatisfying features like [the Wedding Pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/u6ga94/video_games_the_sims_4_my_wedding_stories_pack/) that failed to deliver on its promise to have guests sit down and watch the wedding. Additionally, theres a huge modding scene creating anything from script mods to cosmetic items that isnt exactly drama-free. The pro-paywall and anti-paywall wars have been going strong for almost as long as the game has existed.

This story is nowhere on that scale. This drama is about a minor change to a gameplay trait so universally despised and thoughtless, EA walked it back immediately. This is the story about the few short weeks when rape was part of the Sims official gameplay.

I realize Sims exist only for the entertainment of the player/God. Consent doesn't exist in the Sims world. In the real world, however, it is both very real and very important. Its not surprising that players would apply this concept to a life simulation. Ill be talking about Sims consenting to mean performing actions in an impaired state that they, due to their in-game traits, would not agree to if in any other emotional state. In doing so, I dont mean to at any point trivialize or make light of sexual assault in real life and if Im insensitive or tone-deaf, please let me know.

To explain why I even had to write that disclaimer, I need to explain two game mechanics that influence a Sims behavior before moving on to the controversy.

**Get To Know**

Sims personalities comprise three traits. These are supposed to give your Sims distinct personalities but due to poor tuning and the Emotion System most Sims still feel pretty samey. The traits have always been criticized because they were more fleshed out in previous games. Over the years, EA has made attempts to improve some of these traits to varying levels of success.

In terms of traits, the Hates Children trait is pretty self-explanatory. These Sims hate children and get Tense or Angry in their presence. They get Bored reading childrens books, get Tense when pregnant, and are Happy when they take a negative pregnancy test.

Thats the idea at least. In reality, the negative moodlets arent very strong and Sims who Hate Children interact with children autonomously and get positive moodlets from doing so like Sims without the trait do. The hate also doesnt extend to babies or toddlers, really nerfing what could be a fun trait for those looking to bring some dysfunction into their family gameplay. I think we all agree that a Sim who Hates Children shouldnt always be cooing over the damned baby, yet thats where youd often find them.

**Try to Calm Down**

Sims lives are often ruled far more by their Emotions than their traits. The only time Sims arent feeling things is when theyre asleep. They can be Fine, Happy, Flirty, Confident, Energized, Inspired, Playful (and Hysterical), Angry (and Enraged), Bored. Tense, Sad, Embarrassed (and Mortified), Scared, or Dazed. Some whims (wishes the player can fulfill for reward points) and interactions only appear when a Sim is feeling a certain emotion. Flirting while Angry or Sad is bound to go wrong and being Flirty in the wrong company can get awkward fast. Some emotions can also be deadly. We dont have time to talk about all the Sims Ive lost because they laughed themselves to death.

**Try for Baby**

In late March 2021, as part of a large Spring update that introduced bunk beds, EA decided to overhaul some of the traits. Initially, they didnt list what had been changed but it was obvious in the game. Suddenly, Clumsy Sims couldnt go anywhere without tripping. Bookworms read books. Cheerful Sims were extra cheerful.

And Sims who Hate Children?

Most of the changes were positive. They would now get Tense, then Angry when around kids and also move away when they get to the Angry stage, which sounds about right.

Another bullet point stood out though. Let me quote [the changelog](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429180826/https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/sims-411-recap-4-27-2021) (since deleted):

&gt;Asking a Hates Children Sim to Try for Baby has no chance of success unless the Sim is Dazed.

You know, Dazed, that emotion Sims get when theyre sick, do a keg stand, get beat up, take medicine while not sick, are hypnotized, poisoned, electrocuted, or [eaten by a Cowplant.](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Laganaphyllis_simnovorii) (A popular mod that introduces alcohol and a variety of drugs into the game also makes copious use of it.) Dazed inhibits skill gain, gives Sims a slower, bedraggled walking style, and sometimes they see stars. The only Whims a Dazed Sim will have are Go to Sleep, Sleep it Off, and Take a Nap (and theyre all the same interaction). In addition to that, they are far more susceptible to death by electrocution.

And thats the state a Hates Children Sim needs to be in to agree to Try for Baby.

(The WooHoo interaction, the Sims equivalent to sex with perfect birth control, remains unaltered.)

So, to have a Sim who Hates Children Try for Babyan interaction that doesnt happen autonomouslyyou have to get them Dazed, the equivalent of tricking someone into having sex without protection against their will. And you, the player, are the one doing it.

You tell me if that sounds off somehow, because to me, it sounds a lot like rape, specifically stealthing, as a gameplay feature.

For comparison as part of the same trait overhaul, asking Non-Committal Sims, also not very likely to want children, to Try for Baby had a very low chance of success, which adds some gameplay challenge and realism without any consent violations.

**Lecture about Responsibilities**

The outrage was quick, strong, and universal. Sims players, who at least online skew young and progressive, were Tense and Angry.

[Some had noticed that there was something off with Trying for Baby](https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion-Feedback/Hate-Children-non-committal-Sims-have-try-for-baby-fail-all-the/td-p/10257468) with Sims who Hate Children for several weeks before EAs patch notes but didnt figure out that you could work around someones family planning choices by getting them Dazed.

When the patch notes came out and they put together what had happened, it was not well-received.

Some were angry it took away from their gameplay options. The popular 100 Baby Challenge was much harder to play if you couldnt Try for Baby with anyone. Seducing a Sim while multiple children scream around you is hard enough without having to find out your partners traits and adjust according to that (by either not Trying for Baby with them or getting them Dazed.).

However, the loudest and most enduring complaints were not about gameplay limitations but sexual consent. [This bug report for the new feature summarizes it nicely](https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion-Feedback/LAUNDRY-LIST-Unfortunate-implications-of-Hates-Children-Dazed/td-p/10299186):

&gt;I realize that this is intended behavior, and not a bug. However, this aspect of the Hates Children trait seems to echo serious real-life issues a bit too closely. While I'm certain this was not the intention, it feels as though The Sims 4 has added elements of date \[rape\] by allowing a Sim to convince a Sim who does not want kids to try for a baby if the Sim is intoxicated (in the Dazed mood). I just don't feel like complicated issues of consent while intoxicated belong in The Sims 4.

It just didnt feel right that this was now a feature when iconic elements from previous games, like burglars and [the Sexy Dancer (later Party Dancer)](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Entertainer) bursting out of a cake, had been excluded from the Sims 4 for being inappropriate for a childrens game. But explicit sexual assault somehow didnt cross that line in the Sims developers eyes?

This also reawakened discourse about [alien abductions](https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Alien_abduction)a staple of the franchise present in every gamefrom which male Sims usually return pregnant. Wasnt this sexual assault too?

One notable difference between the two features is that alien abductions and the resulting pregnancy are not player-directed or explicitly non-consensual. The player cant trigger an abduction but can imagine what happened during the abduction off-screen where they cant as easily handwave dazing a Sim so the Sim will agree to a pregnancy.

Whatever your view on alien abductions in the Sims, I feel Confident in saying that almost no Sims players have real-life traumatic experiences with aliens that might be triggered by the game. The same can unfortunately not be said for sexual assault. Sure, you can simply adjust your gameplay to not have children with Sims who Hate Children but knowing that the presence of the option to violate their consent is upsetting even if you dont personally make use of it. (And since its a gameplay mechanic, Im also not judging anyone who used it.)

Nobody seems to have thought EA had malicious intentions. Its the thoughtlessness they took issue with. How had this made it into the game despite its obvious implications?

**Smooth Recovery**

We would never find out *how* this happened (and really, why would we?) but the Sims team responded to [the viral tweet I linked in the header within a day](https://twitter.com/storylegacysims/status/1388212829224845312):

&gt;You are absolutely right! We appreciate you all holding us accountable to our values  especially when we miss the mark! Consent isnt something to play with, so weve updated our language &amp; will correct the trait in an upcoming patch.

The patch notes were quickly altered to read, Sims with the Hates Children trait will be very unreceptive to any Try For Baby actions with no exception when theyre dazed.

This satisfied Sims players, and the next patch a few weeks later eliminated the feature. Now its harder to Try for Baby with a Sim who Hates Children but when it happens, players can in good conscience say that no Sims were traumatized or harmed in the process.

In terms of controversy, it was a minor blip in Sims discourse, far overshadowed by the ongoing anger about the introduction of kits, small $5 DLC that include cosmetic items. A whopping 19 of them have since been released and they remain controversial.

Additionally, around the same time [several huge Sims custom content creators on Patreon were revealed](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/u4fteb/if_you_are_a_patron_of_several_huge_cc_creators/) to be putting trackers on their files and  actively shar\[ing\] information on patrons, mass-blocking them, and coordinating attacks against them, so its surprising the Hates Children controversy gained any attention at all.

But that doesnt make it any less Embarrassing, nay Mortifying, that this happened because none of the developers realized that this was not a great idea in any game, let alone one rated 12+.

Gui was the eldest child of the [Gui family](https://i.imgur.com/0K6FHuH.jpg) who including Gui were ethnic Korean. Gui was described as ""filial and sensible"" and all of their neighbours knew and liked Gui. According to her younger sister, she had a lively personality and a good academic performance which made her family proud. In 1991 she was admitted into Xiamen University located in Xiamen in China's Fujian Province. with a score of 530 on the college entrance examination. She was admitted to The Foreign Language Department and specifically studied the Japanese language being the only student that year to enroll in that lesson.

At university, she was a study committee member in her class and won a first-class scholarship but sadly this wouldn't last. March 7, 1993, started like any other day with Gui's roommate saying that Gui woke up, washed herself, ate and had a friendly discussion with her dormmate with the two laughing and having a good time. As March 7 was a Sunday and with no classes, Gui wanted to go on a walk along the beach and offered others to come with her. None of her friends and classmates were free so Gui headed out on her own being seen wearing a black top with a large white lapel, dark blue suit pants, and a pair of black flat shoes.

on March 9 Gui's father Gui Guangxian and the editor-in-chief of the Korean version of ""Liaoning Daily"" received a phone call from Gui's counsellor in the foreign language department at Xiamen University. They informed him that his daughter had been missing for 2 days after going for a walk along the beach and that the entire school looked for her but couldn't find her. Gui Guangxian and his wife Bai Wenshu weren't able to sleep and spent the entire night awake trying to think of what could've happened such as if she was killed in a robbery/mugging, kidnapped or ran away from school but they both refused to accept the possibility that she may have left voluntary as she would always send her family letters and seem to enjoy her time at the university very much. The next day March 8 was also a special event at the university that Gui was excited for and actively participating in and preparing for.

Her family quickly set off for Xiamen and once getting there headed straight to the university. The university staff agreed to cancel classes for another day so the students and staff could continue searching for Gui. Her dorm room was also searched and she had left behind all her yuan and both her ID and student ID cards. Her diary was also read and nothing strange or alarming was found in her writings.

Gui's classmates and fellow students printed off Gui's picture and created their own missing person notices and placed them alongside distributed them in Baicheng Beach, Huangcuo, Hecuo, Zengcuo'an, Jimei, and the air-raid shelters near the seaside in Xiamen. The police were also contacted and they searched alongside the beach and found no signs of a struggle. Their efforts succeeded in bringing awareness as now all of Xiamen knew about Gui. After 20 days of tireless searching no viable leads were uncovered. According to two fishermen, they saw the figure of someone resembling Gui walking alongside the shoreline but their claims have not been corroborated. It was also during this 20-day period (March 9-March 29) that the body of an unidentified woman washed ashore on the beach. The body was shown to Gui's family and classmates but they all told the police that it wasn't Gui. Nothing else is known about this woman including her true identity aside from the fact that she was a woman/girl and likely young.

During the next two years, Gui's family would devote all of their time to trying to find Gui and travelled to the various cities and provinces they suspect she may have been in such as Beijing, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia and [placed her missing person notices in various newspapers across China](https://i.imgur.com/QU9yFdO.jpg). On November 13, 1994, they got their first lead.

In Guangdong Province, there was a news article published by the Yangcheng Evening News titled ""Girl, where is your home?"" the article showed a picture of a mentally unwell girl who was allegedly trafficked and sold five different times and resembled Gui. After seeing it Gui's family travelled to Guangzhou the very next day. According to reports the girl was being held at Xinshan Village and Gui's family spent two hours walking to the rural village after arriving in Guangzhou.

When they said they were the possible parents of this girl they were led to a dilapidated bamboo hut where the girl was being kept. She was dishevelled, with only one button on her blouse. She curled up in fear when she saw them enter, her eyes were a little dull, and she couldn't answer any questions. There was a long-cut wound along her sole caused by a knife and rope and ligature marks on her arms and wrist. She was rescued after being sold to a 60-year-old man for 1,000 yuan. When the girl finally raised her head to look at the family they noticed that she had a large prominent mole on her forehead which was a feature that Gui lacked meaning that this girl was not Gui. Gui's family had to leave but before they did they gave the girl 20 yuan and left. Her real identity remains unknown.

This image never left Gui Guangxian's mind and realized that several other girls and women suffered the same fate so after returning to Guangzhou rather than getting on a flight back to Shenyang he instead travelled to Beijing and went to visit the ""All-China Women's Federation"" He told them the story of his missing daughter as well as the story of the trafficked woman he had just met in hopes that they could help. And indeed they could as they made sure to [get the story published in all of China's major newspapers](https://i.imgur.com/L8Mtisj.png) bringing more exposure to Gui's case than ever before.

On November 17 Gui Guangxian was still in Beijing when he encountered a familiar face. He asked if he was from ""Eastern Time"" and the man confirmed this and identified himself as Fang Hongjin who at the time was still a well-known and respected news reporter. He told his story and the story of the unidentified woman and Guangzhou and on December 5, 1994, [Fang would dedicate a section of his show to discussing the case](https://i.imgur.com/yH7iVbX.jpg). The segment also showed the police removing the girl from the dilapidated hut and bringing her to a hospital for professional help. Although his own daughter was still missing Gui Guangxian was at least glad that he had helped this girl and that with all this now nationwide coverage his own daughter could be rescued.

On May 23, 1995, there was another lead. Wang Wandi a villager living in Daheng Town located in Fujian province. At Daheng near the entrance of the village a girl described as ""ragged"" was found she had big eyes, double eyelids, and a ""pretty face"" Wang and his wife approached her and brought her home and informed the rest of the villagers. The villagers gathered around and tried to ask who she was but she only laughed, cried and sometimes sang in English. She was given a pen and paper and wrote the names of the protagonists of various Qiong Yao dramas, English words, chemical equations and mathematical formulas. She, however, could not write her own name or home.

Once he heard of the case Gui Guangxian informed The Fujian Women's Federation and he alongside representatives of the Federation travelled to the village to see the girl. While Gui was 1.53 meters the girl was very similar only 1.52 meters. Gui Guangxian tried to talk to her but she wouldn't respond to anything that he said. Gui Guangxian was given a sample of the girl's handwriting and he said that it looked very similar to his daughter's. Gui Guangxian had one more test in order to try and verify if she was Gui. It was mentioned above that Gui's family were ethnic Koreans and that Korean was their mother tongue, this is important as Gui Guangxian wrote down My daughter, Gui Meiying, go home soon in Korean and showed it to the girl. She didn't recognize the Korean alphabet and thought it was a mathematical formula. Gui's classmates also arrived at the village and looked at the girl and they all said that it wasn't Gui.

The girl spoke with a Hunan accent so Zhou Zhiqian the representative of the Women's Federation began listing various places in Hunan Province such as Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Hengyang to see which one she responded to the most. As time began to pass she became more and more calmed and lucid and could finally write down her information. She said that her name was Wu Hailian and lived in Baota village which was located in Hunan. Gui's family was willing to adopt her if her family could not be located but they were eventually found and Wu was reunited with her family on May 27.

After this second encounter, Gui Guangxian began to write to the State Council asking that they create organizations to fight against trafficking and establish a missing person rescue organization, and establish a missing person rescue foundation and that he would be the first to donate to these organizations.

There were no new leads after this and soon Gui Guanxian and his wife were in their 70s and unable to continue their efforts with their youngest daughter Gui Haiying having to support the family.

However, after hearing about the Xuzhou chained woman incident they began to have hope that their daughter could be found again due to new technology such as the internet and DNA. DNA samples were taken from Gui's family and compared against China's database but no matches were found. Gui's picture and information on her disappearance would also regularly be circulated throughout newspapers but to no avail.

Gui Meiying remains missing to this day and March 7 this year will mark the 30th anniversary of her disappearance.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Slanek, Venlil Space Corps***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 4, 2136*

The memories trickled through my brain, as a deep chill rattled my body. I was disoriented and immobile, uncertain of my surroundings. The current time and location were indeterminable; haziness obscured my conscious thoughts. My mind reached out for context, in an attempt to ground myself.

We had been caged in the Tilfish nursery; I was shot during the fray. Marcel had propped me up, ignoring the strain on his own body. Orange blood flowed onto his chest pelt, and perspiration beads coated his skin. Dino tagged along, whimpering as my eyes began to turn glassy. Virnt was back in Birlas arms, asking why the Venlil was leaking.

We were a ragtag band, stranded on Sillis. I remembered now.

The grays had been hot on our heels, and we hobbled toward the emergency exit. My vision was fixed on the floor tiles, which were mired with my dripping blood. General Birla urged Virnt to cover his ears, as she dispensed my firearm at the Arxur. I think the carnivores refrained from gunning us down, because they wanted to capture us alive.

*There was more. We had to get to the emergency exit, didnt we? Why is it all slipping out of reach?*

Shoot me, I had coughed at Marcel. Save yourselves&please, brother.

The predator refused to let go, bending his arm tighter around my torso. Tiredness threatened to consume me, as the vegetarian popped errant shots over his shoulder. Images flitted through my brain, from various moments of time; that forced snarl was his classic empathy rendition. That same expression had consoled me when Sovlin held him at gunpoint.

Not too long ago, Id been feeding the half-dead Terran by hand. Amid the chaos, I recalled hoping that Marcel knew how much I cared about his welfare. There were terrible screams, both near and afar, which sent my heart pounding. Despite all of the nightmares we had endured, I wouldnt change a thing about our partnership. Even if Marcel was losing patience with me, I hoped he still felt our bond.

*Think Slanek. The screams. There was something there.*

Those had been Tilfish screams, as the incubator workers came running in droves. Our hasty escape hadnt given me time to don blinders; Id seen it all. The civilians distracted our Arxur pursuers, stampeding past them at full speed. As much as the grays wanted a Venlil delicacy, this easy meal toppled into their laps.

Our ragtag band stumbled out into fresh air, and I was wholly leaning on Marcel for support. There were more Arxur in the street. I think that was the memory in its entirety; Id glued the pieces back together. We needed to find somewhere to take cover&to take&

Birla clicked her mandibles in the backdrop. Slanek? Slanek, you have to keep your eyes open.

I drew a gasping breath, and my pupils snapped to my arm. Judging by the dark hue and the profuse leakage, the bullet hit a vein. There was a wet sensation on my hindlegs; at first, I worried it was blood from my wound. However, the realization that the brick tunnel we were in was a rotting mess ensued. A few inches of murky liquid amassed across the floor. Perhaps this was a sewer system underground?

My addled brain shook off the stupor, and I searched for Marcels comforting presence. I scanned every shadow for the lurking human. This wasnt the first time the predator had been around my blood, so I knew that he could handle the alluring scent. On Sovlins ship, Id been immobile with a head wound, and locked in an enclosed cell without food. Even then, the human had cared about my welfare.

There was no reason a vegetarian who loved rescuing animals should need to get away from blood. Humans werent drawn to it like the Arxur; Id never seen them react positively to a whiff of it. That ruled out that explanation for why my friend was missing. What if Marcel had gotten hurt? I couldnt remember how we made it down here at all.

Why are we not going to space with humma? Virnt wailed.

Birla patted him soothingly. Shh, darling. Go back to bed.

*Dino is missing as well. What if the dog ate Marcel? Or&I guess more likely, the grays got them both.*

Where&is M-marc? I pressed one paw against the wall, and tried to sit upright. How did we get here?

The Tilfish general blinked with concern. You dont remember? The human carried you into an access hatch, and checked that it was clear. He put you down, told me to patch you up&but I dont have anything for first aid!

Okay. Where is he now?

Said something about hearing Arxur in the tunnels. Took that feral quadruped

Dino, mama! Virnt cheered. Dino the dog!

Yes, that thing. Anyways, Marcel went looking for enemies. Mentioned clearing the tunnels, and keeping us safe.

And you let him go alone?

The human said to stay with you. He was blinking a lot&Im not sure if your blood bothered him.

It would never. M-marc was upset that Im hurt, if anything.

Are you sure, Slanek?

Of course Im sure! He was fine around a Gojid stampede. They all&the humans all were. He saved&a trampled child.

There was a long pause, as skepticism swam in the Tilfish generals eyes. I knew the insectoid wouldnt ditch Marcel, when the primate was our best asset against the Arxur. But I suppose few individuals beside myself would tempt a predators bloodlust. It took personal exposure to humanitys nurturing side to accept that their empathy dominated.

*Marcel said himself that he doesnt like killing. Humans can balance empathy and violence; its what I told him at the supply tent.*

A gunshot exchange sounded down the tunnel, and fear clenched at my heart. The adrenaline boosted me back to alertness, but I couldnt stand up. Bootsteps smacked the floor, alongside the sound of munitions chipping bricks. A human yowl reverberated through the structure, followed by Dinos throaty barks. Tears swelled in my eyes, realizing Marcel would die alone.

I reached out to Birla, and pulled myself up with the last of my strength. Hunched over at the waist, I staggered in the direction of my friends cry. The Tilfish general tried to grab my shoulder, flinching away as blood coated her leg. With a frustrated grunt, I hobbled down the tunnel. It wasnt long before I was leaning against the wall for support.

FUCK OFF! That was Marcels thunderous voice. It was possible to discern the words in this roar, which was more formidable than any Id heard before. This is my turf! Youre not coming in here, assholes!

My legs buckled, and I crumpled back onto the floor. Why hadnt I reclaimed my firearm? The coldness was becoming palpable, making me wish for a human pelt to cocoon myself in. At least Marcel was still fighting, but I was in no state to rescue him. My pupils fluttered in his direction, as I sucked in some wheezing breaths.

The human was hugging a wall corner, and I could see his teeth flash from here. His hands popped off a few shots, while enemy rounds buffeted his refuge. Brick debris sprinkled overhead, as Marcel clutched his gun tighter. Dino was growling at his side, though the mutt appeared to be waiting for something.

Surrender yourself, human! We have room for an honorable prisoner, a bone-chilling voice called out.

A maniacal laugh emanated from Marcel. What is it with aliens, drawing my name in the kidnapping and torture lottery? Ill pass.

I crawled along the floor, moving a few inches at a time. Since I was wounded anyways, my best usage was to serve as a distraction. The Arxur might wish to collect me as cattle, and that could give Marcel the clear shot he needed. The chances of us surviving Sillis were slim overall, but the Terran would fare better without my dead weight.

Scuttling noises echoed behind me, and Birla came racing down the hallway. The Tilfish general righted my seized firearm, angling it toward the Arxur. Despite her distrust, she was willing to come to the human's aid. In my opinion, she shouldve gone with him to begin with&better late than never, I suppose.

Three Arxur ducked around the corner, just as Birla halved the distance. The insectoid had a trusty shot, clocking one gray in the brain. Marcel released Dino upon the hostiles, and depressed his trigger. Enemy bullets answered, taking out a brick right above his head. I could feel his adrenaline vicariously; his binocular eyes were crazed.

*I have to help somehow. The Slanek acting weak distraction seemed to work the last time&should I try it again?*

Yummy Venlil! Over here! I cried out, with a faltering voice.

The Arxur had already scented my blood, I assumed. The trail mustve drawn them down here, unless they followed us from the surface. It was possible they waited for us to lower our guard. While Id technically been conscious in our travels, it was tough to retrieve the memories. There was a chance I wouldnt remember any of this now.

The two surviving grays werent as distracted as the egg raiders had been, but I saw their pupils twitch. The lack of impulse control was in stark contrast to humans; I suppose I was lucky that Isif and his bunch didnt wolf me down in New York. A little blood or a wounded animals cry worked their kind into a frenzy, even amidst combat.

Marcel cursed, realizing Id abandoned my refuge. The human popped up from his crouch, and the grays rushed to shoot him. One bullet whizzed dangerously close to his earlobe, while additional shots lurked in the chamber. The lead Arxurs sights aligned with his temples; I felt my blood pressure plummet. Was that from my wounds, or just grief?

NO! I screamed.

There was nothing I could do to stop the bullet from piercing his brain. The Terran had become reckless out of concern for me, and he was paying the ultimate price. Marcel managed to take down one gray, in a final act of defiance. The next thing I heard was a deafening boom, as the monster shot my best friend.

The predators head snapped back with unnatural speed, and he crashed onto his back. I screamed as the human lie splayed out on the floor. Dragging myself on all fours, my toes bled from the frantic pace. My frayed vocal cords screeched his name, while warm tears ran down my face. The grief I felt was a chasm in my chest, an all-consuming sadness.

Birla dispatched the final Arxur, and scuttled over to Marcels side. I managed to reach the predators body, which was still warm to my touch. It was tough to see through blurry vision, but his hair didnt look like a deeper red than usual. The blood was imperceptible to my eyes&perhaps I didnt want to see it. My brain must be imagining the rise and fall of his chest; that, or he was slipping away right now.

Im sorry, I whispered. You w-were the best friend I ever had. I failed you. I always f-failed you, and I&MARCEL! D-dont leave me!

*Why did my human have to die? Why?!*

My emotions devolved into an incoherent whirlwind, and I released a visceral wail. I slammed my good arm into his gut, furious at the universe. A high-pitched yelp came from beneath me, and Marcels corpse shifted. My vision refocused on him, watching as he moved an arm to his head. The humans eyelids fluttered, and a grimace crossed his face.

My best friend pinched his nose. Oh God&that rung my bell.

The grief that was fueling me dissipated. I clung to his warm chest with sobs of relief, and Dino came over to lick his face. Marcel pushed the dog away, an instinctive snarl on his lips. He unclipped his helmet, inspecting it with amazement. I gasped at the nick in the cloth lining; the bullet had grazed my human on the dome.

The red-haired soldier hoisted himself up, clutching me to his chest. I felt his wonderful fingers fiddling with my ears, and mewled my adoration. Alarm coursed through my veins, as Marcel stumbled. His skull absorbed much of the impact; the Terran might well be concussed. But he was blissfully alive, and that was music to my ears.

I love you, Marc, the same as I did my flesh-and-blood brother. I care about you so much, I whispered in a faint voice. I know I disappointed you. But you&you never disappointed me.

His hazel eyes moistened. What did I tell you? I got the best Venlil. Im only disappointed in how you view the world.

It took Marcel an agonizing minute to retrace his steps, and arrive at our impromptu base. The predator sank against a wall, and leaned his head back. He allowed me to burrow into his stomach, snarling through his exhaustion. Virnt was giddy at the hummas return, though his mother kept him at a distance.

Marcel peeked at my arm, and his mental fog vanished. He snapped at Birla, livid that she hadnt tended to my wounds. The Tilfish general cowered at his ferocity, but I could tell he was just rattled. My human knew how close he came to dying; it didnt help his mindset to reckon with my critical condition.

The human cleared his throat. This might hurt, okay? Everything is going to be alright, Slanek. Im not going anywhere.

Please forgive me. Theres nothing I w-wouldnt do for you. I wrapped my tail around Marcels wrist, and tensed up as he stitched my wound. I&I dont want to leave any&bad blood between us.

You hurt my feelings, thats all. Virnt should be institutionalized for liking me? Im that terrible to my best friend?

Its&n-not likeOW! I l-like you. But t-things about you&should trigger fear at first.

Why? You know the Federation lied to you. They lied about us, omnivores like the Tilfish, and basic biology. Im telling you it was all lies: predator disease and feral predators are their ideas too. Stop regurgitating them.

T-there are people with predator disease. They&hurt people.

But predator disease isnt just assigned to violent sociopaths. Its used on anyone whos wired differently. Do you realize by the Federations definition, *you* have predator disease?

No. Thats c-crazy, Marc.

I know. I fucking know! Mental health is a complicated thing, with thousands of conditions with unique attributes. Not all of them are violent. Not all of them need to be erased.

Marcel finished patching me up, and retrieved a radio from his supplies. I mulled over his words, though my brainpower was running on empty. If predator disease was another vessel for Federation lies, that meant we were locking away harmless people. No wonder my human was upset with my suggestion for Virnt. It was the same as how Doctor Zarn wanted to treat me for defending Marcel.

*So there are different types of predator disease, with different causes and manifestations. And they&we use fear to ostracize every patient.*

Im sorry, I croaked.

Marcel squeezed my paw. Im sorry too. I shouldve talked to you about these things sooner. Its my responsibility to educate you, but Ive just tried to shield you.

I know Im not easy to talk to. I&I know it hurts you when I freak out&or misinterpret you. You know, I wanted to kill Dino earlier&and I almost did.

None of that matters now. Youve been my rock, Slanek. You brought me back from the edge, and you made me believe there was good in the galaxy.

T-thats all I could ever want. Hey, if anything happens to me, tell my parents what w

Tell them yourself. Were getting out of here. Im going to call for help, and try to make contact with the UN. Sounds good, huh?

I didnt have the heart to tell him the United Nations was long gone. Just as they hadnt come back for the soldiers on the cradle, nobody was swooping down to the sewers to rescue us. General Birla seemed unconvinced as well; the evacuation announcement stated the deadline in no uncertain terms. At least I could share my last hours with Marcel, rather than dying alone.

My human switched on his radio. UN fleet, do you copy? This is Captain Marcel Fraser; we have a Venlil VIP in need of medevac. Transmitting our coordinates, over.

There was no response once Marcel finished his message. The static didnt seem to deter his efforts, since he repeated his transmission several times. I nuzzled against his wrist, and felt my eyelids becoming heavy. The predators warmth helped with my dropping temperature.

Dont worry. Ill keep calling them, Marcel growled. When they beat back the Arxur, theyll come.

I closed my eyes. Yeah. Humans will win.

We sure will. Sleep well, Slanek.

Dino sidled up to me as I dozed off, and my instincts rekindled. He placed his coarse snout on my leg, and my mind circled back to Federation lies. The dog hadnt shown any signs of being evil; he seemed loyal to the humans through thick and thin. Maybe Marcel was right about giving him a chance too.

Predators couldnt be inherently monstrous when the Terrans existed. This was a simple choice about whether the Federation defined the Venlil. I pressed one paw atop the dogs back, trusting my human to protect me. Marcel wouldnt put me in danger, and he said Dino was a friend.

The safest place in this Arxur raid was sandwiched between two watchful predators. Knowing this slumber might be my last, I drifted off at peace with my fate.

2023-02-25,1677318547,"Humans Are Awful At War","*Humans are awful at war*, concluded envoy Ö-Three-Eyes in her first assessment of the newly integrated species' ability to reliably defend their corner of the Orion Arm.

In a vacuum, without the Great Chain knocking at the metaphorical door, it would have been an interesting conundrum. Compared to its neighbours, humankind didn't lag behind in technology. Their understanding of the universe was roughly on a par with that of most Agora species, and while they were a few generations behind when it came to biotechnologies, their material science was nothing to scoff at. Visiting their fifty-odd worlds, Ö-Three-Eyes witnessed many feats of engineering that humans had every right to be proud of. She saw geoscale wind-wheels in their gas giants, fusion lanterns warming up icy worlds, O'Neill cylinders housing millions of inhabitants, space elevators stretching out from their garden planets, faster-than-light spaceships glittering at the edge of reality, trailing hyperluminal wakes between the stars.

One thing, however, was strangely absent: *weapons*. It wasn't that humans didn't have *conflicts* \-- in a rather amusing episode, Ö-Three-Eyes found herself involved in a five-way squabble between human communes, ending up in a close pass between two several terawatt-strong fusion powered ships. Simply, they didn't seem to have *wars*. Laser grids on their ships were limited to asteroid defence, the only missiles she could find were used as launchers and particle beams were nowhere to be found. Their ground forces were effectively nonexistent and, safe for a few ballistic submarines lurking beneath the oceans, the humans didn't seem to have much in the way of planetary defences. The only martial activity they entertained were ""Flower Wars"" -- pretend conflicts that served more as spectacle than anything else.

Ö-Three-Eyes was intrigued. It was extremely rare to find species that were true pacifists. *Pretend pacifists* existed -- civilisations that prided themselves on being pacific, but would stand ready to unleash their wrath on those they assumed to be deserving of it. She had but contempt for them. They were all old, ancient civilisations whose main claim to fame was to have emerged from their homeworld a few thousand years before the others and could now rest on their laurels. Humans were anything but that. They had no hidden stockpiles and they were certainly not a sleeping giant. They were not a submissive species either, disarmed by a long-gone master, or biologically unable to exert aggression. No, realized Ö-Three-Eyes after a few decades as an ambassador, *humans were pacifists by choice*. It was a deep-seated principle, their way of living in the interstellar age.

Once again, not a problem, hadn't their little corner of the galactic community turned into a March with the sudden disintegration of the empires of the Perseus arm in front of the Great Chain's relentless advance. Member species of a March were expected to receive various advantages, in exchange of which they would stand firm for the Agora, protecting the borders of the multi-species democracy. Ö-Three-Eyes thus faced a problem. The Earth and its daughter-planets were extremely valuable, and the humans were not equipped to defend them against the tidal wave of the Great Chain. The envoy considered the direct neighbours of humanity, wondering if they could make up for humanity's shortcomings. The Messer hivemind was the archetypal March species: a strong, deeply united civilisation capable of throwing untold billions of soldiers in the path of the Great Chain. The Pleiadians were less fit to combat, but still a great addition to the Orion March. The delicate, blue-skinned humanoids had a taste for particle beams, and could strike at the Great Chain from long distances with their planetkillers, harassing the fleets as they crossed the inter-arm void.

How would humans ever fit into that? For a time, Ö-Three-Eyes considered a grim possibility -- she could manipulate either the Pleiadians or the Messer into annexing human space and putting them under their wing. They would easily win a war. But the Agora wasn't a competing arena of scheming species, it was a galactic democracy and if Ö-Three-Eyes believed in one thing, it was the fundamental truth that all sophonts had a right to self-determination. No. She could not do that. Then what? Arm the humans by force? Have them retool their industry for war? There was no time. The Great Chain would hit within a few decades, and in its state, the human economy would take at least a century to transition to military production. Everything was to reinvent and develop -- and more importantly, Ö-Three-Eyes feared it would alter human society and psyche to such a point they would inevitably revolt against the Agora.

When the first tendrils of the Great Chain reached the Orion March, Ö-Three-Eyes braced and feared for the worst.

It did not come to pass. There was one thing she hadn't quite figured out about humans. Their pacifism wasn't passivity. Like many things -- such as their syndicalist organisation, or their environmentalism -- it could be traced back to their industrial age, to the era where they had almost choked on their own civilisation. Humans had forgotten how to fight, but they had not forgotten how to *act*. Four centuries prior, they had narrowly avoided disaster by focusing their societies, economies and cultures towards the singular goal of safeguarding their own homeworld. The arrival of the Great Chain, of this unyielding force bent on conquering the Local Group, brutally reignited this drive.

In the first months of the invasion, Ö-Three-Eyes noticed a peculiar thing -- the Orion March was holding better than she would have thought. The Messer armies were more mobile than usual, plugging gaps in frontlines and evacuating lost worlds with a swiftness she had not expected. The fragile Pleiadians replenished their fleet losses much faster than at the height of their previous wars and always narrowly avoided running out of their precious relativistic kill vehicles. The statistically significant oddities, in both cases, were explainable by human activities.

Ö-Three-Eyes, just as an idle thought, perused the statistics of human interstellar trade.

Holy Stars. That was *a lot* of ships.

Several hundred thousand, at least -- and most of them had been spontaneously converted into supply and utility vessels. With human space ideally positioned between the Messer and Pleiadian spheres, the children of the sun could easily transport resources, personnel and knowledge from one side to the other. Devoid of weapons, entirely designed around speed and capacity, their cargo vessels moved in hundred-strong formations, supplementing the supply lines and economy of the other two civilisations. It was more than help -- the human contribution acted as an exoskeleton for the Messer and the Pleiadians, multiplying their ability to hold and fight back.

Many worlds were lost against the Great Chain, many billions died, but at no point did the line falter. There were gigantic cargo ships running constant back and forths between the industrial gas giants of human space and the bio-furnaces of the Messer hive; fast couriers informing Pleiadian artillery-stars of Great Chain advances with nary a few days of delay; FTL-capable shipyards following in the wake of interstellar battles, standing by to replenish ammunition and repair damaged vessels; and even a few formidable ""prime movers"", massive antimatter-powered clippers that could haul entire flotillas between stars, sparing Messer and Pleiadian ships the stress of a group long-range hyperluminal translation.

And all of that without mounting a single weapon on their ships, without firing a single shot, without even using their own drives in self-defence. The human devotion to pacifism had something of a mythical oath; even as they lost thousands of ships and millions of people to the Great Chain, they did not break it.

When the second wave -- the true invasion, the real tendril of Great Chain Fleet Orion -- hit the March two decades later, all the local civilisations had changed. The Messer hive had turned into a war machine of stellar proportions, churning out dedicated lifeforms by the tens of billions from worlds turned into planetary scale corallian reefs. The Pleiadians had built a cosmic wall of fortresses through the arm, Nicoll-Dysons beams aimed outwards, and their fleet was now equal to none in sophistication. And the humans...

As battles unfolded, Ö-Three-Eyes marvelled at them. Their supply ships were now directly integrated to the Messer and Pleiadian battle order, acting in unison as if they had been part of the same species. Pleiadian clippers and Messer moths screened them as they moved, but the escorts were not always necessary. Within a very short timeframes, humans had radically overhauled their propulsion technology; equipped with military-grade power generators, but without the weapons to complement them, human cargo vessels could brute-force their way through extremely long-range hyperluminal jumps, bypassing Great Chain blockades with ease. The human network now allowed the Messer and the Pleiadians to act as one single war economy, each of them covering the other's weaknesses with human space as a hub of stellar proportions. Unconcerned with the manufacture of armaments, the great artisanal-industrial complexes of human space churned out medicine, supplies and non-military equipment for its allies. Its extreme versatility was stretched to its limit, but the adaptability of humans quickly allowed them to size up to the pre-war Messer and Pleiadian economies. Entire human planets had been converted to fac-similes of Messer hives, while Pleiadian specialists oversaw whole gas giant systems where their technology blended in with human machinery.

From probes dropped in the billions to advanced hydrogen steamers shadowing the tendrils of the Orion Fleet, the children of the sun painted a picture of the invader crisper than any telescope. As the Great Chain started threatening human systems, their allies jumped to their rescue -- at the height of the war, human cargo ships often worked double duty, ferrying goods out and reinforcements in. Some systems were lost to the enemy, but the humans surprised Ö-Three-Eyes by their swiftness to relocate and start anew. As the Great Chain approached to consume their worlds, they simply moved their O'Neill stations away and retreated in order.

Thirty years after the beginning of the assault on the Orion March, the Great Chain finally identified the true cornerstone of the staunch defense it faced -- the Earth itself. Sweeping through a weak point in Messer hive-armies, hundreds of thousands of ships made a beeline towards the Sun. A strategic masterstroke -- and a terrible mistake.

The three allied races had Great Chain Fleet Orion right where they wanted it. As the Messer and the Pleiadians converged on the solar system, an apocalyptic battle erupted in the Kuiper Belt, quickly spreading towards the outer planets. Human supply lines now operated pointblank. The geoscale wind-wheels of Saturn and the magnetic tethers of Jupiter beamed power directly to Pleiadian laserstars, demultiplying their firepower. Automated asteroid bases manufactured billions of Messer drones, throwing them into the battle instantly -- even as they were overrun, even as they were destroyed, they kept working until nothing was left. Moving sunwards, the partial Dyson plates of Sol fed Pleiadian relativistic artillery stations with untold petawatts of power, firing at Great Chain capital ships near-constantly. At the height of the astronomical unit-spanning exchange, human cargo ships delivered Messer hive ships directly into the fray, before adding the plumes of their engines to the concert of all-spectrum jamming and interdiction zones criss-crossing the solar system. In a remarkable display of pettiness, humans even used their telescopes to shine powerful lasers at Great Chain targeting drones.

The battle lasted for a whole month. Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus were lost. Saturn held. Mars was bombed. The Earth was briefly landed upon, and for five glorious days the Pleiadian elite defended human cities. A billion allies died. Sol, now the single most heavily defended system in the Milky Way, braced for a second wave.

None came. Of Great Chain Fleet Orion, nothing was left but stragglers. The Orion March had held and the humans hadn't fired a single shot. Yet, Ö-Three-Eyes' colleagues at the Agora agreed on one thing -- victory was theirs.

A century later, as the Great Chain was crumbling and in disarray, Ö-Three-Eyes visited the solar system once again and was surprised to find a Pleiadian planetkiller bearing human identification signals, orbiting in the depths of the Oort Cloud. Had the experience of the war finally convinced humankind to arm itself, and with such a terrifying weapon?

Upon closer inspection, it turned out that they were in the process of turning the planetkiller into the first prototype of an interstellar disco ball.","HFY",112,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/11bh8qp/humans_are_awful_at_war/"

The flagship state university about 2 hours from us has a really cool week long soccer camp this summer that registration has just opened up for. All 3 of them would be qualified for it based on the select team's (try out required) they play for.

The camp is not cheap (about 3k) but I think it'll be a great experience and the coach for the high school they're going to is somewhat involved in the operations of it, so going may help the odds of making the highly competitive soccer team. Jake is really excited and we were going to register him for the camp, same deal with Phil. My sister and her husband however dont think they can afford it due to Beth's husband getting recently laid off. I feel bad but it is what it is. They suggested we all send them to an in town camp at the same time that is about 1/4th the price. I talked with Jake and he'd much rather do the stay away one and I  agree he should so Im fine with paying for it. Beth however is begging me to reconsider. I thought about offering to pay for Mike but my wife said we shouldnt because we'll be going on a vacation to a very nice adults only all inclusive while he's away to make the most of it and thats just a lot of money to spend.

If you've seen the popular 1990 film adaptation, then you just know it as the story of a square-jawed, vaguely noir-ish detective who fights a series of impressively ugly criminals in a city that is never actually stated to be Chicago but clearly is. But the original comic strip by Chester Gould started in 1931 and continues to run to this day, and in its 91 years of existence...things have gotten weird.

[Very, very weird](https://i.redd.it/gf7bc65zle461.jpg).

# ""Tracy, this is the biggest job you've ever tackled!""

In the earliest days of the strip back in the 1930s, detective Dick Tracy's archnemesis was a gangster known as [Big Boy](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/64684/1281433-bbc_001.jpg) (whose actual name, Gabe Famoni, was not revealed until a 2019 strip) clearly based on Al Capone. Big Boy started the strip by kidnapping Tracy's love interest Tess Trueheart and murdering her father. After being arrested, he served as a sort of background villain behind the scenes before gradually disappearing from the strip.

Big Boy was pretty indicative of the sort of villains Tracy fought in early strips: a grounded, reasonably realistic member of an organized crime group whose plots include things like robbery and murder. Over the next twenty years, however, the strip would be home to increasingly bizarre villains, including [a man with four foreheads stacked on top of each other](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dicktracy/images/a/a2/Brow.jpg), [a guy with a pouch of loose skin around his neck that he keeps a gun in](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dicktracy/images/7/75/PouchProf.jpg), [a guy with hair on his face instead of the top of his head](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/pqw5sm/the_brush_1962_one_of_the_strangest_dick_tracy/), and many other bizarre and deformed criminals. There wasn't any in-universe reason for this--Tracy's city wasn't near Chernobyl or anything--but Chester Gould just liked drawing weird looking villains.

# ""A Thud! And All is Quiet--Very Quiet""

Around this time, the strip also got significantly more violent. While earlier comics might occasionally show someone being shot, the storylines in the 40s and 50s featured increasingly imaginative murder methods and increasingly nasty deaths. A guy [put together a crude homemade electric chair and killed his wife with it](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/kxggpa/dick_tracy_1941/). Tess Trueheart, now married to Tracy, [cut a man's throat with a piece of broken glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/ksno0w/dick_tracy_1939_featuring_chester_goulds_classic/) in self-defense. In one particularly famous storyline (which I posted on r/comicstriphistory a while back and which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/search/?q=the%20brow&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=&amp;sort=new) if you want to read through it) Gould introduced two characters named May and June, the Summer Sisters, who were apparently based on his daughter and her best friend. Aw, how sweet! I wonder what wacky wholesome adventures they had?

Well, &gt;!they worked for a Nazi saboteur who tortured them one at a time to keep the other one from running off until they shot his guards, shoved him headfirst into his own torture device and ran to the police for protection. He survived by ripping off part of his own face to escape, hunted them down and rammed the taxi they were in off a bridge. Trapped in a submerged car, May frantically tried to open the door while June hugged her and cried. At the very last moment, they were rescued by...nobody. Both of them drowned. The end.!&lt;

The strip's level of violence did cause some controversy; a number of papers dropped it over the years, although it was always popular enough to keep gaining new ones. In one particularly infamous later comic, Tracy shot a criminal and announced that ""Violence is golden when it's used to put down evil!"" on the day after Robert Kennedy was assassinated. That's some impressively bad timing.

Having been around for a few decades by this point, Dick Tracy had quite a rogue's gallery of former villains, and many storylines in the 1950s began to center around references to old storylines. Classic villain Flattop Jones turned out to secretly have a son who came to town looking for revenge. The diamond thief known as The Mole got out of prison and teamed up with his granddaughter Molene in a storyline that infamously involved Tracy [staring directly at the reader and explaining that police officers should be able to arrest anyone at any time without needing stupid stuff like ""evidence""](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dicktracy/images/7/70/Commentary.jpg). A number of supposedly dead antagonists turned out to be alive decades later, including murderous gangster Mumbles, Nazi agent Pruneface, and Adolf Hitler. Strangely, although these villains had usually aged significantly by the time they reappeared (something which was often a major plot point), Tracy himself remained young and apparently immortal, something which nobody in the strip ever pointed out. This means that, since the strip always takes place in the present, Tracy is now well over a century old and looks the same as ever.

By the 1960s, Dick Tracy had become almost formulaic. Yes, ""gruesome violence"" + ""constant references to storylines from decades ago"" + ""deformed hideous characters"" might be a strange formula, but it is still a formula, and one that was frequently parodied by other comics. Al Capp's Li'l Abner featured [Fearless Fosdick](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/gxfdwb/fearless_fosdick_circa_1952_link_to_full/), who considered gunning down thousands of innocent people while hunting down a petty criminal to be reasonable collateral damage. [Daffy Duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ly35NQfZw8) showed Flattop Jones using his head as an aircraft carrier. [Tricky Cad ](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/frtjs5/tricky_cad_1959_a_surrealistic_parody_of_dick/)turned Dick Tracy into...whatever the hell this is.

It was becoming clear that Dick Tracy, while still popular and acclaimed, was becoming a tad bit repetitive. As the Space Race began, Chester Gould thought ""what if I turned my detective comic into a sci-fi space opera after thirty years?""

# ""Now the Daughter of the Man in the Moon Will Dance!""

In the early 1960s, as the USA and the USSR began to compete in order to land the first human beings on the moon, Dick Tracy introduced new sci-fi elements in order to take advantage of the new public obsession with space. Tracy got a Space Coupe, a spaceship which he used to travel to the moon and meet the native Lunarians, a race of people with enormous eyes and antennae who can live for over a millennium. One of them, known as Moon Maid, became a major character, eventually marrying Tracy's adopted son Junior. (Although Tracy's family and friends generally did not age, Junior had grown up from a small child to an adult before eternally staying in his mid-20s.) Moon Maid and Junior would eventually have a daughter, named Honeymoon Tracy, who was born in orbit halfway between the Earth and the Moon and has magnetic superpowers.

Around this time, there was a real-world [Moon Maid Lookalike Contest](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX055q9UYAAAksT?format=png&amp;name=900x900). Women all over the country competed for prize money and a movie contract by dressing as a fictional alien, and the eventual winner was college student [Sheila Hanson](https://web.archive.org/web/20230219171329im_/http://media.ideaanddesignworks.com/library_ameri_comics/covers/dick_tracy/Moon1.jpg)...at least in real life. (We'll get to the weird meta elements surrounding this contest later on.) Despite the widespread popularity of these new sci-fi elements and the continuing success of the strip, many fans of Dick Tracy's older comics were disappointed to see the way it had changed.

And one of the people most upset about this would end up writing the strip himself.

# ""That Bomb was Meant for You!""

In 1977, Chester Gould retired from writing and drawing the strip which he had created 43 years before. The strip's writing was taken over by mystery writer Max Allan Collins, who had grown up with the version of Dick Tracy in the 40s and 50s, and hated the newer science fiction elements that Gould had added. Under his tenure, Moon Maid was referred to only as ""Junior's wife"" and her alien nature was barely acknowledged. Honeymoon Tracy's hair covered her antennae and she was treated as essentially human. The Lunarian flying machines Tracy had used throughout the 1960s were gone; he was back to car chases and hunting down criminals on foot.

Collins didn't want to stop there, though. He brought back the strip's very first villain, Big Boy, who had recently been released from prison decades after his arrest by Tracy. After finding out that he was terminally ill and would soon be dead, Big Boy decided to spend what little time he had left on one thing and one thing only: revenge. He put out a million-dollar hit on Dick Tracy, causing a number of previous villains to come back hoping for a shot at the money. Although Tracy himself would survive, Moon Maid was [killed in front of her entire family](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicstriphistory/comments/cekhb0/for_anyone_who_doubts_that_dick_tracy_is_the_most/) when she borrowed his car, not realizing that a bomb had been hooked up to the ignition. This resulted in a diplomatic disaster which led to the Moon People cutting off all contact with Earth, allowing Collins to neatly remove every sci-fi element of the strip in one go.

After the 1983 death of Rick Fletcher, the artist on the strip, he was replaced with Dick Locher. Locher would continue to work alongside Collins on the strip until the syndicate was reorganized in 2006. Not wanting to pay two people to work on one strip, they fired Collins and had Locher take over the writing in addition to drawing the art. And the Locher era was...weird.

From 2006 to 2009, Dick Tracy's general strangeness took on a new element: events would be shown multiple times over the course of a week, often occurring slightly differently and viewed from a different angle each time. Here's an example:

Why? I have no idea, honestly. Maybe it's so you can only read the comic a couple times a week and still not miss any plot points. Maybe it's an intentionally trippy effect to show the characters' panic and uncertainty. Maybe Dick Locher just had Alzheimer's and legitimately forgot which plot points had already happened. Regardless, this era is generally seen as containing some of the worst Dick Tracy comics around. Personally? I love it, but hey, I've never been entirely sure whether I like this comic ironically or actually think it's good.

# ""A Special Passion for the Moon""

By 2012, the strip had been taken over by a new team, Joe Staton and Mike Curtis. Just as Max Allan Collins had wanted to return Dick Tracy to the way it had been when he was a kid, the new generation of writers wanted to bring back the sci-fi elements they nostalgically remembered. As a result, they brought back Moon Maid, despite the fact that she had been dead for 35 years at this point. Dick Tracy decided to investigate and find out who this person really was, and discovered that, true to Dick Tracy tradition, the answer involved murder, hideous villains and characters from multiple storylines from decades before. Warning: pointlessly convoluted comic-strip lore incoming.

Remember that Moon Maid Lookalike Contest? Well, that canonically happened within the universe of the strip (where Moon Maid was a famous celebrity rather than a fictional character) as well as in real life. The second-place winner of the fictional version of the contest was Glenna Ermine (who is also called Mindy Ermine sometimes because, in case you haven't figured out by now, Dick Tracy canon is a mess) whose father murdered the organizers of the contest after she lost. After she fled to Mexico to avoid jail time, she was eventually kidnapped by Dr. Zy Ghote, a villain originally from a different, unrelated storyline who decided that, due to her resemblance to Moon Maid, she would be a perfect subject for his latest plan: making a fake clone of a dead alien for fun. He brainwashed her and gave her plastic surgery in order to make her both look like and have the memories of the original Moon Maid. After this was revealed, she became a recurring character in the strip.

(That *other* storyline that Dr. Ghote originated in was about him claiming to have cloned a serial killer for fun, except it turned out the ""clone"" was just the original serial killer pretending to be his own clone. Like I said, it's a weird comic.)

# Leaping Lizards, it's Little Orphan Annie!

You've almost certainly heard of Little Orphan Annie. Like Dick Tracy, it was originally a comic strip, but was made into a much more popular adaptation--a musical, in this case. It's had many remakes, reboots and so on, changing things until the original comic was almost forgotten. Unlike Dick Tracy, the original strip is no longer running, and ended in 2010 in the middle of a storyline where Annie had been kidnapped and ended up in, apparently, 1944. The strip ended abruptly with Annie kidnapped and Daddy Warbucks desperately trying to find her, which many fans found to be an incredibly depressing and disappointing ending. But Dick Tracy's creators decided to help out.

Shortly after the ending of Little Orphan Annie, Dick Tracy also got kidnapped and found himself in the same place as Annie, which was eventually revealed to be a fake 1940s town put together for some convoluted reason (I genuinely didn't follow what was actually going on in this storyline, sorry). After this, Little Orphan Annie became a recurring character in Dick Tracy, and a classmate of Tracy's alien/human hybrid granddaughter as well as a friend of the woman who was kidnapped and brainwashed into believing she was an alien. I am so glad to have been able to write that sentence.

In the years since then, not a lot of major events have happened in the strip. Oh, sure, there's been plenty of violence, and lots of weird stuff like an in-universe movie where Dick Tracy is the villain and the heroes are alternate versions of the various murderers, Nazis and gangsters from the strip's history (which is a bit like making a real-world movie where an evil immortal Elliot Ness must be stopped by a team made up of Al Capone, Heinrich Himmler and Ted Bundy). There was a [genderswapped version of Donald Trump](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dicktracy/images/0/06/MystaBellow.jpg). There's plenty of weirdness to be had. Dick Tracy may be known as a pretty straightforward detective story to most people, but if you look closer you'll see that it has one of the most bizarre and incomprehensible universes of any comic, and hopefully it continues to be just as weird as it approaches its 100th birthday.","HobbyDrama",185,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11ab5xa/comic_strips_the_madness_of_dick_tracy_how_a/"

I'm a new single mom. My partner of 15 years cheated and walked out on me and our 12 year old son. He left me with $1500 in bills a month. I work extremely hard as a server to cover everything he left me with. I files for child support in October, signed paperwork in January but the courts are so slow he hasn't even been served yet.
In the meantime while I wait, he refuses to help out or pay a single cent. His name is still on the lease to the apartment he left me with. 
I've asked him repeatedly to pay his portion of the lease, and I've asked repeatedly for him to help pay for a babysitter for our son while I work, and I've asked repeatedly for him to pick up our son while i work. He refuses all.
I can't afford a sitter. I'm paying out more than I make and I'm losing money. 

I'm in the state of Michigan, and as far as I can tell the law says a 10 year old can stay home alone. This weekend he called the police on me for leaving our 12 year old home and threatened to call CPS. But yet, he won't help with anything. The police didn't call me, or make contact with me. I went this morning and everything seemed to be in the clear. Then I called CPS and they said 13 was the age to leave him alone.
I'm confused on what is right here.

My 12 year old has a cell phone, we've had extensive conversations about safe neighbors to go to. I've been teaching him since summer to stay home by himself (father had no issue with this until this weekend and even bought him the cell phone for this purpose), I call my neighbors and let them know he's alone. One neighbor calls my 12 year old and asks him if he's all right and to come to the window and wave. The other neighbor goes upstairs to check on him while I'm gone and he's welcome to go to their apartment at any time. I leave him with food, peanut butter and jelly, lunchables, he has water, juice and snacks. And I call every half hour to check on him and I only work about 4 hours or so.

I've taken every safety precaution I can come up with. This is not ideal and I'd rather not leave him home alone, but I feel stuck in this position. Everything is in order and seems to be fine except for the operator on the CPS line telling me the age is 13 not 12.

There's going to be a lot of text in this post so feel free to skip down to the summary to get the overview of the detailed situation.

#Part 1: The 2012 College Football Season

Every college football season has its interesting stories that set themselves apart and 2012 was no different. An undefeated Ohio State was blocked from the postseason because some players on the team 2 years prior had traded memorabilia for tattoos. The Heisman winner and Heisman runner-up would have stories interesting enough to warrant Netflix documentaries. Here, I'll talk about the 2012 Notre Dame team that ended up with 0 wins, 0 losses and a national title.

If you are confused, seeming to remember Notre Dame having played a season in 2012, you would be correct. In fact, they had an impressive run: starting the season unranked and finishing the regular season ranked as the unanimous #1 team in the AP Poll. Although they didnt play in a conference championship game, they had an impressive resume including wins over Pac-12 champion Stanford and Big 12 co-champion Oklahoma. Like most other national champions of the time, Notre Dame was then invited to play in the BCS National Title game. Unlike most other champions of the time, Notre Dame lost this game 14-42, losing much of the credibility gained through the first 12 games of the season. 

So how exactly does a team win a national title without actually winning the championship game?

#Part 2: The Colley Matrix

Unlike other NCAA sponsored sports, College Football does not have, and has never had, an official champion crowned for a given year in the sport. Instead, national titles have been left to be determined by polls or mathematical systems which choose the best team. In its early history, the sport was very regionalized making it difficult to compare teams from different areas of the country. As the postseason of the sport has evolved, more games have been played between top teams helping to differentiate who stands at the top of the sport in a given season. Since 2009, every major selector has chosen the team that won the BCS/CFP designated national championship game except for one.

The Colley Matrix is a computer ranking system developed in 1998 which is one such major selector. The system was first used in 1998 coinciding with the first year that the BCS system was used and in fact was one of 6 computer polls used for the BCS ranking calculations. Some of the main qualities that the poll uses to define itself include its lack of bias (all teams start the year equal), an emphasis on strength of schedule (beating tougher teams nets more points), and an emphasis on wins and losses while ignoring margin of victory. The [website](https://www.colleyrankings.com/) for the Colley Matrix details how the system works, but essentially its a really complex mathematical system that means well but comes up with some controversial conclusions from time to time.


As you may have concluded by now, the Colley Matrix rated Notre Dame as its #1 team following the 2012 season putting them above the Alabama team that had just blown them out in a championship game. Its important to note that Notre Dame doesnt claim this national title as it only claims in years where they finished #1 in the AP poll or the Dickenson System in the years before the AP Poll was developed. Regardless of how the university views this, the title is legitimized by the NCAA and even appears in the official NCAA [record book](http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2021/FBS.pdf). 

Now one has to wonder: since the Colley Matrix is the only selector that has chosen against the a different champion from the rest of the selectors, can a team really try to claim a legitimate title from it?

   
#Part 3: UCFs 2017 Season

Much like Notre Dame, UCFs national title run is quite unorthodox. To start, one of UCFs biggest regular season games against Georgia Tech in September was canceled due to hurricane Irma. Due to a perceived weaker schedule, mostly due to them playing in a Group of 5 conference and having a game against a Power Five opponent canceled, UCF entered the bowl season ranked 12th in the College Football Playoff rankings, leaving them far from playoff contention. Instead, UCF was relegated to the Peach Bowl to play AP #7 ranked Auburn.

Despite missing out on the College Football Playoffs, UCF went on to claim themselves national champions for the 2017 season after the win over Auburn, before the CFP title game had even been played. Unfortunately for UCF, a team cannot just declare itself champions without any backing legitimacy. Luckily for UCF, the Colley Matrix exists and had them #1 at the end of the postseason. While many mocked UCF for this claim, there were a number of things in UCFs favor which helped to support the claim. UCF was the only FBS team to finish the year undefeated, including a victory over Auburn who themselves had a victory over the CFP champion and runner up. UCF received 4 first place votes in the final AP poll, the first and only time in the CFP era that a non-CFP champion has received any. 

Now we've determined that, like UCF, Notre Dame has a (sort of but not really) legitimate claim to a 2012 title, but earlier I mentioned that the team had no wins or losses. So what happened to the 12 wins and 1 loss that they had?

#Part 4: The NCAA

In November 2016 news broke that an athletic trainer at Notre Dame had committed academic misconduct for several football players throughout the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons. The NCAA dealt a number of punishments to Notre Dame for these violations, but the most severe was the vacating of all victories from these 2 seasons. At 21 wins between these 2 seasons, this tied for the most wins a team had been forced to vacate at one time. Notre Dame tried to appeal this decision on the grounds that it was unusually severe, but it was officially denied 5 years ago on February 13th 2018, forcing them to vacate these games. 

The punishment of vacating wins is not rare in college athletics, however; Notre Dames situation was slightly different. Instead of only vacating the wins during this time, Notre Dame was also asked to vacate their appearance in the national championship game in the 2012-2013 season. The act of vacating a game which the punished team lost is rare enough that the only other situation Ive been able to find where this has happened was USCs 2005 season where they also went undefeated, lost in the championship game, and had their season vacated due to an NCAA violation. Despite the misconception that only wins can be vacated, both Notre Dame and USC have 0-0 records in years where they lost the title game and this is verified through [official NCAA sites](http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch).

One thing that the NCAA does not have the authority to vacate, however, is the Colley Matrixs selection of Notre Dame as champions. While Notre Dame may never claim this title, there is nothing stopping anyone else, including the NCAA themselves from recognizing it. What were left with is the NCAA giving legitimacy to a selector that chose Notre Dame as the champion while simultaneously wiping out the win and loss records of that season ever occurring for the team. 

Now we've determined that Note Dame technically won a title in 2012 and technically went 0-0 that season as well. One remaining question is: is it really fair to Alabama to have a split title in a year in which they beat Notre Dame in the postseason?

#Part 5: The 1973 Sugar Bowl

With the best record in the SEC, #1 ranked Alabama received a bid to play in the Sugar Bowl as did undefeated #3 ranked Independent Notre Dame. Oklahoma finished the regular season ranked #2 however; the Big Eight banned them from playing in a bowl game this season due to recruiting violations. As such, the Sugar Bowl was set to be the de facto national championship in the first ever meeting between the Crimson Tide and Irish. Notre Dame ended up winning the game 24-23 and earned the AP #1 spot with 33/50 first place votes. 

Despite finishing the season without a single first place vote in the AP Poll, Alabama finished the season first in the Coaches Poll. The reason for this being that the Coaches Poll released its final 1973 poll before bowl games were played. Early in CFB history, bowl games were seen more as exhibition games than anything else, but over time, the postseason games would become more and more significant, now being some of the most impactful games in a season. The AP Poll only started releasing the final polls after bowl games starting in 1968 and Notre Dame didnt even start regularly participating in the bowl season until 1969. While Alabamas claim was not unfounded given the historical nature of bowl games, the coaches poll decided to run its final poll after the bowl games starting in 1974. Alabama has every right to continue to claim this title, but it is very telling that the Coaches Poll immediately changed their system the next year so that this situation would never happen again. The main point to highlight here is that Alabama claimed a national title in 1973 despite ending the season with a bowl loss to Notre Dame. 

#Summary

In 2012 Notre Dame lost a national championship game to Alabama, but were ranked #1 in the Colley Matrix which is a major selector legitimized by the NCAA. The NCAA went on to vacate Notre Dames entire season leaving their final record as 0-0. There is historical precedence for both claiming a title based on the Colley Matrix selection (2017 UCF) and by ignoring the results of the postseason (1973 Sugar Bowl). In conclusion, as far as I am aware, Notre Dame was the first team to end up with a 0-0 record and still win a national title. Notre Dame should claim this title if for no other reason than because of the absurdity of it.","CFB",255,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/111pzov/the_absurdity_of_notre_dames_00_2012_national/"

It is critical that journalists, policy makers and everyone else working to address campus sexual assault understand these basic statistics...""","Source #1: https://jimhopper.com/topics/sexual-assault-and-the-brain/repeat-rape-by-college-men/

&gt; **What Percentage of College Men Admit to Committing Rape?**

&gt; Survey studies of college men have found rates between 4% and 16% (e.g., Lisak &amp; Miller, 2002; Abbey et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2013).

&gt; Importantly, these surveys do not use the words rape or sexual assault. Rather they use clear behavioral descriptions of rape. And those descriptions explicitly state that penetration occurred against the womans will (e.g., even though she did not want to). So none of the rapes or attempted rapes reported by men in these studies had anything to do with perpetrators believing the women had consented.

To emphasise: you get more valid data by asking men about behavioural descriptions of the act, not by using terms like 'rape' or 'sexual assault' which those men will deny due to e.g. Social Desirability Bias.

&gt; Please note that we cant know whether the mens responses are accurate or honest reflections of their actual behavior. Some men do not admit to themselves  let alone to researchers, even on an anonymous or confidential survey  that they have committed such acts even when they have. **So these 4-16% statistics and the others presented here are likely underestimates to some extent.**

Emphasis added.

 &amp;nbsp; 

 &amp;nbsp; 

Source #2 is from the UK: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/29/research-reveals-rapes-and-assaults-admitted-to-by-male-uk-students

&gt; Of the 554 male students surveyed, 63 reported that they had committed 251 sexual assaults, rapes and other coercive and unwanted incidents in the past two years, according to researchers at the University of Kent.

That's over 11% of these male students self-reporting these incidents.

&gt; It identified a strong association between toxic masculinity and sexual violence, with those who reported committing offences also admitting to misogynistic views, such as believing that women who get drunk are to blame if they get raped, and having sadistic sexual fantasies about raping or torturing women.

I don't think this will be a surprise to anyone.

&gt; Perpetrators were significantly more likely to endorse offence-excusing myths associated with rape, eg victims are to blame for being assaulted, and to have more negative sexist and hostile views about women, eg believing that many of their troubles were the fault of women, and to report sexually fantasising more about harmful, such as physically hurting their sexual partner when they didnt have consent to do so.

Nor will this be a surprise. So this is a strong reason to tell people to leave rape-excusing men, which I know for a fact many posters here do when these topics come up in posts (e.g. from an OP asking for advice about their partner).

2023-03-05,1678039497,"The many origins of Shiinotic: An overly long analysis of the most underappreciated Alolan Pokémon (tl;dr at the end)","Though some may find it forgettable, Shiinotic is my favorite Pokémon of all time, and I'm about to go over all the reasons why through a Reddit post of excruciating length. Alas, Shiinotic is not a very popular Pokémon, and it's easy to see why: a lot of people find it too creepy or uncanny to like, especially compared to Morelull, most of its inspirations aren't immediately obvious, it's never been featured prominently in any of the games, and even in its first appearance it was horribly overshadowed by nearly every other new Grass- and Fairy-type Pokémon. To my knowledge, not one person has ever cared enough about this freaky mushroom-man to write a thorough analysis of its design, its relevance to the Alola region and just why it has the Fairy type... until today.

**Part 1: Mycological Roots**

First, let's take a moment to talk about its heart-meltingly adorable pre-evolution Morelull, an empty-eyed bioluminescent mushroom whose name comes from ""morel"", a famous type of edible fungus, and ""lull"", referring to how its spores can induce sleep; hopefully you haven't been pronouncing it as ""More-lull"". While Morelull may sound innocuous, merely feeding on nutrients from tree roots and soil to sustain itself and never staying in one spot so as not to cause more harm than it needs to, it has potential to be as deadly as any Fairy Pokémon: the Japanese Sun and Moon website speaks of an incident wherein a Morelull colony's spores flew into the vents of an airplane that was flying overhead, putting those on board to sleep and nearly causing a crash!

Shiinotic is best described as ""creepy cute"": it's a taller, more humanoid mushroom with the same hollow eyes as Morelull, but the additions of a blank, off-putting smile and long, green mycelium fingers through which it drains the vitality of seemingly whomever it sees fit, making for one of the more unsettling Fairy-type Pokémon; or, it could be described as a cross between a Toad from Mario and the Landlord from Super Milk Chan. Dangerous as it may be, it's not completely cruel; the anime shows that Shiinotic can also share energy with those they take a liking to, in a similar manner to how mycorrhizal fungi transfer nutrients from the soil to their botanic symbionts. Its name can be broken down into ""shiitake"", a common edible mushroom that grows on decaying wood; ""shine"", referring to its ability to produce phosphorescent light; and ""hypnotic"", referencing the idea of putting one to sleep through hypnotism, the mind-influencing psychoactive agents found within certain mushrooms, and how certain bioluminescent animals beguile prey with their mesmerizing lights.

In most languages, Shiinotic's name pertains to mushrooms and light: in both Japanese and Korean, it is Mashade, and its French name is Lampignon, which reveals that its line also takes inspiration from night lights, lamps and lampshades. The Pokémon Company directly acknowledged this in the promotional artwork for the ""Snorlax's Yawn"" merchandise, which depicts a bedroom filled with all manner of Pokémon-themed furniture, including a Shiinotic bedside lamp situated atop an Aurorus dresser.

Before going into any more detail about what could have inspired Bowling Pin Toad's appearance, it would be wise to first explain its typing. Grass is easy: prior to the revelation that fungi don't actually photosynthesize, they spent ages being conflated with and incorrectly classified as plants. As for Fairy, fairies have been associated with nature, and therefore mushrooms, for almost as long as the idea of fairies has been a thing. Over time, this has lead some lucky 'shrooms to be bestowed with such monikers as ""dryad's saddle"" and ""fairy inkcap"", as well as Shroomish and Breloom being placed in the Fairy Egg Group. During a time when people made less distinction between medical science and magic, the potential medicinal, toxic, or hallucinogenic properties of mushrooms earned them a history of use in ""sorcery"" and shamanic rituals, a trope that still persists in popular culture to this day. In fantasy stories, they're often used as potion ingredients by wizards and witches; funny enough, Shiinotic's design can be read as a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a cauldron, though it's hard to say whether or not this was deliberate.

The mushroom most frequently depicted in fairy stories and paintings, and arguably the most recognizable fungus of all, is the poisonous and hallucinogenic ***Amanita muscaria***, the red-and-white toadstool commonly known as the fly agaric. You know the one: sometimes it's shown being used as a seat or dwelling by a fairy or gnome, other times it is but one detail in an enchanted forest filled with wonder. It has since been adopted by popular culture as *the* go-to look for a wild mushroom, starting with Renaissance paintings and working its way up through Alice in Wonderland, to The Smurfs, to Mario and Minecraft, to even Pokémon's fifth generation of games, which used it as a basis for Foongus and Amoonguss. Some have also speculated the fly agaric to have religious connotations of varying levels of plausibility, from being the Soma described in ancient Hindu texts, to even being the forbidden fruit consumed by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

The *Amanita* genus is best known for its poisonous species, including some of the most toxic toadstools known to man; while some are in fact safe to eat provided they are correctly identified, others contain downright deadly levels of toxins. Though Shiinotic may not be poisonous, lacking the type and only learning one Poison-type move, it shares some of the other trademarks of mushrooms in this genus, including a wide convex cap covered in patches or warts, and a volva - that's the pink, sack-like structure that forms the lower part of Shiinotic's body, a remnant of the universal veil that envelops the mushroom during its infancy.

In addition to *Amanita*, Shiinotic is based on ***Mycena*** fungi, of which 59 species are known to produce **fairy fire**. Fairy fire is one of the three names for the ethereal glow produced by chemical reactions within certain fungi on decaying wood, the others being foxfire and chimpanzee fire. In particular, Shiinotic's pink cap is reminiscent of species such as *M. rosella*, *M. pura* and *M. purpureofusca*; if we branch out to other families, an even closer match is the Pink Waxcap, *Porpolomopsis calyptriformis*. While foxfire-producing fungi mainly emit it from the mycelium, the fruitbody, or both, the slippery mycena (*Roridomyces roridus*) specifically only has bioluminescent spores. The anime shows that this isn't true of Morelull nor Shiinotic, but nevertheless their Pokédex entries mainly describe their light as being emitted from their spores; likewise, *M. pruinosoviscida* is known to emit light from both fruitbody and spores. Other *Mycena* species that may hold relevance here include *M. interrupta* and *M. nargan*, also known as the pixies' parasol and the spotted pixie cap respectively; as well as several species that go by variations of ""fairy helmet"", such as the bleeding fairy helmet (*M. haematopus*).

All of this is, of course, a perfect fit for Alola: bioluminescent fungi are most common in temperate and tropical climates, and Hawaii is known as the Rainbow State (hence Team Rainbow Rocket, the Prism Pokémon Necrozma, Minior's many colors and the bedazzling Bruxish). Hawaii is home to many species capable of producing light - mostly aquatic animals and bacteria, but also the fungus ***Armillaria nabsnona***, whose mycelium is bioluminescent. In general, *Armillaria* are better known as honey fungi, for many of their species have yellow, yellowish-brown or straight-up brown caps that match up with shiny Shiinotic's, such as *A. ostoyae*, *A. luteobubalina* and *A. mellea*.

Honey fungi are an example of a facultative parasite: they grow in the roots of living trees and eventually kill them, but they've adapted to eat both living and dead organic matter - they'll continue to feed on their host even after it perishes, regardless of whether it was actually the fungus that did it in. While Shiinotic's signature move, Strength Sap, is obviously based on how fungi ""sap"" nutrients from their environment through their mycelia, the fact that it drains opponents of their strength yet gives them nothing in return brings to mind parasitic fungi which derive all of their nutrients from their hosts, such as honey fungi. Shiinotic's default color scheme also gives it the most ""psychedelic"" vibe of all fungal Pokémon, which may not be entirely a coincidence: on top of its fly agaric inspiration, magic mushrooms - yes, the ones with hallucinogenic alkaloids - mainly occur in the tropics and subtropics, including Hawaii, where you may come across *Panaeolus bisporus* and *Panaeolus cambodginiensis*.

Yet another potential mycological reference lies in HachijM-jima, the southernmost of Tokyo's Izu islands. From the end of World War II through the end of the 1960s, the government made efforts to promote it as the ""**Hawaii of Japan**"" to increase investment and property development. It just so happens that multiple species of *Mycena* fungus known to emit a pale green light are abdundant on this island, including *M. chlorophos*, *M. pruinosoviscida*, and *M. lux-coeli*, the last of which was long considered to be endemic to HachijM-jima until it was found on other Japanese islands decades later.

**Part 2: Mythological Roots**

As mentioned previously, shiny Shiinotic takes its color scheme from various honey fungi, making it the second Pokémon inspired by a parasitic fungus. The first was Parasect, and these two are linked in more ways than just sharing the same base stat total and evolution level: in Pokémon Sun, the Pokémon that attacks when you collect the Tiny Mushroom for the Lush Jungle trial is a Parasect, whereas in Pokémon Moon it is a Shiinotic. In Alola, Paras can only be found during the day, while Morelull is a night-only encounter. The cherry on top is this Shiinotic Pokédex entry:

&gt;Ultra Moon: When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!

Paras only appearing during the day is accurate to real cicadas, most of which are diurnal, but what about Morelull? Well, fairies in general have long been thought to come out exclusively or more often at night, including and up to the **Menehune**, a seldom-seen race of forest-dwellers spoken of in Hawaiian mythology. Though considered fairies, Menehune have more in common with dwarves, including their short, stocky build and exceptional craftsmanship. According to legend, the Menehune reside deep within the mountain forests and caves of Hawaii, away from any human civilization; stand at about 23 feet tall, barely shorter than Shiinotic (3'03""); and only be active at night, during which time they would establish fantastic fish ponds, roads, houses and temples. They've been credited with building some of Hawaii's finest ancient architecture before even the first Polynesian settlers arrived there.

In contemporary Hawaii, the term ""Menehune rings"" is sometimes used to refer to **fairy rings**, perfect circles of mushrooms which can cause rings of grass around them to either grow taller or wither and darken, depending on the fungus (ironically, these necrotic zones are the exact thing Morelull does its best to avoid creating). It's certainly no coincidence that three of the fungi able to grow in fairy rings are in the *Amanita* genus, which Shiinotic is already known to draw inspiration from. Even outside of Hawaii, fairy rings lend their name to the vast folklore surrounding them. Let's take a look at some more Pokédex entries:

&gt;Sun: Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.

&gt;Moon: It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.

&gt;Sword: Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.

&gt;Shield: If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don't go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.

This is bog-standard fairy behavior. Many mythological fairies such as redcaps, boggarts, dullahans, rusalki and the nuckelavee were *highly* dangerous to those they crossed paths with; others were said to be or utilize will-o'-the-wisps - known in Welsh folklore as **fairy fire** - which would entrance or bewilder travelers who saw them at night. To reiterate, Shiinotic's territory is generally *not* worth the risk of encroaching on when it's dark out, just as European folktales would often warn not to step in fairy rings.

Since science hadn't yet advanced enough to disprove it, the appearance of fairy rings was attributed to supernatural beings such as elves, witches or fairies dancing in circles, and could be a sign of either good or bad luck depending on the tradition. At worst, consequences for entering them could range from being transported to the realm of the fae, to unwillingly joining in on the nightly dances until your body gives out. Legends would often paint them as being all but impossible to escape from on one's own, and since time was said to pass differently in the otherworld, your trip to Fairyland could have equated to weeks or even years elapsed in the mortal realm, potentially resulting in a near-instant death from old age after breaking free. The only way to safely investigate a fairy ring was to run around it nine times, specifically under the full moon according to a Northumberland tradition. Other creatures said to be linked to fairy rings include dragons, giant bug-eyed toads, and even the Devil himself.

At this point, you may have remembered that fairy rings are not the only mysterious circles associated with night and the paranormal. One could say that **crop circles** are the contemporary equivalent of fairy rings, even if they aren't created naturally. In some ways, aliens are the spiritual successors to traditional fairies in today's popular culture and urban legends, sharing their unknowability, alien morals, and knack for abducting random people or livestock at night without a thought only to bring them back different, sometimes with no memory of what occurred when they were kidnapped. Fairies have enough parallels to aliens that they would fall under the infamous ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theory, which implies that mythological beings such as gods, angels and the fair folk themselves were in fact aliens who visited Earth long ago. Another discredited theory linking the two is the ""interdimensional hypothesis"", which says that sightings and legends of beings such as ghosts, fairies and UFOs are really cover-ups for visitors from parallel realities or dimensions.

One of the most common perpetrators of alleged alien abductions are the classic **Gray Aliens**, which Shiinotic lines up with surprisingly well. The Illuminating Pokémon shares the archetypal Grays' pitch-black eyes and short stature compared to humans; it has (hyp)notic in its name, potentially referencing the alien brainwashing trope; and its huge, dome-shaped cap could very well symbolize either an enlarged brain or a flying saucer from which an alien may descend upon Earthlings, or use a tractor beam to do the inverse. Aliens being associated with light is nothing new, either. Some of the very first UFO sightings of the 20th century described them as fiery balls of light in the sky; for somewhat more recent examples, just look at E.T.'s glowing finger, or the scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind in which colored lights are used to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership.

This is all too perfect for games titled Sun and Moon: not only are they literally named after celestial bodies, but they also introduced the Light Trio, the astronaut-like Dewpider, the miniature meteor Minior, the extradimensional aliens called the Ultra Beasts, and the seemingly alien NPC in Haina Desert who ""returns to space"" after being shown a Solrock/Lunatone. Moreover, Hawaii has had problems with alien (as in non-native) species for centuries, just not the extraterrestrial kind. Yungoos is based on invasive mongooses that were introduced to Hawaii to control the population of imported rats; the Ultra Beasts are extradimensional beings that are used to wildly different environments from Alola, making them too dangerous to belong there, and Shigeru Ohmori confirmed this to be what the Ultra Beasts symbolize in the first place.

Though there are a couple fungi that are invasive to Hawaii, none seem like they could have inspired Shiinotic. If its creation was influenced by any invasive fungus in particular, it would likely be *Saproamanita inopinata*, one of the two species of *Saproamanita* agaric considered to be invasive by the time Sun and Moon would have started development. *Saproamanita* are in the same family as *Amanita* and were once considered to be the same genus; some species can even grow in fairy rings. *S. inopinata* has not been observed in Hawaii, but rather New Zealand, which has also struggled with invasive species, starting with dogs and rats introduced by Polynesian settlers. This would still fit Alola because some facets of the region were in fact inspired by other Oceanian islands, most notably Komala.

Going back to mythology, there's one last legendary creature that could hold relevance to Shiinotic, and if you're a Studio Ghibli fan, you may have already guessed what it is: the **kodama**, literally meaning ""tree spirit"" in Japanese. Kodama are a kind of nature deity, said to be the animated souls of the ancient trees they inhabit; the few reported sightings of kodama describe them as faint wisps or orbs of light, or as lights with tiny humanoids inside them. The Ghibli movie Princess Mononoke has what is by leaps and bounds the most famous portrayal of kodama, depicting them with entirely white skin and black dots for eyes and mouths. Pokémon is no stranger to referencing other modern media (case in point: Lokix and Baxcalibur; even the very foundation of the franchise, Poké Balls, are an Ultraman reference) so I could totally believe that the Ghibli kodama had an influence on Shiinotic's design.

**The Verdict**

Well, that's pretty much it. In conclusion, Shiinotic is one of the most inspired, well-thought out Pokémon that Generation VII has to offer, tying together a multitude of mycological and mythological references from Europe, Hawaii and Japan alike into an original forest sprite that wouldn't feel out of place in any number of fairy stories, yet also manages to remind us of more modern analogues of the fair folk. Taking into account all these different origins, it's hard to find a Pokémon more deserving of the Fairy type than Shiinotic.

**Tl;dr:** Shiinotic's potential inspirations include lamps and lampshades; mushrooms' folkloric ties to fairies and magic; a literal ""mushroom cloud"" erupting from a witch's cauldron; various fungi of the *Amanita*, *Mycena*, *Porpolomopsis*, *Armillaria* and *Saproamanita* genera, some of which produce fairy fire; Parasect, serving as its nocturnal counterpart and rival; nocturnal Hawaiian fairies known as Menehune; fairy rings, also known as Menehune rings; the double meaning of ""fairy fire"", referring to both will-o'-the-wisps and fungal bioluminescence; Gray Aliens and UFOs; and kodama, specifically the ones from Princess Mononoke.","pokemon",92,"https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/11j5m46/the_many_origins_of_shiinotic_an_overly_long/"

We had many academic staff who thought they were a lot more important than they actually were. And a few who were exactly as important as they thought they were.

We got a call in one day from the PA of one of the latter, who said ""Mister C's Blackberry isn't working anymore, can you please come and have a look at it?"". 

Mister C was an adjunct appointment - meaning we probably didn't actually pay the guy. He was the former head of a national political party and in the running to be Prime Minister at one time. We were under instructions to keep the guy happy. Fair enough. 

So we didn't actually provide or support Blackberrys, and it was a bit of a surprise to get a support call for one of them, but again, Mister C was Important, so I went along to see what the problem was. 

I arrived to Mister C's office and had a look at his blackberry. Sure enough, it had been remote wiped and bricked. I gently brought up that this looks like it had happened, and asked where it came from. He said ""I got it from parliament, I use it every day"". Being a follower of news, I again gently said ""I don't presume to know your business, but I recall you didn't run for re-election 6 months ago, do you think that because you're no longer a member of parliament, that might be why?"" .. the proverbial lightbulb went off and he said glumly..

I didn't have a single credit of college when I entered.

I was a renter for my short time as an adult with my wife.

While in? 

1. 100% medical care, no deductible. Tricare is some of the best insurance you could ever have. Didn't even have to pay for cough drops as I could request them. I often hear complaints of the quality of healthcare in the military, but usually from people in the civilian world that have no concept. Paid for all my children's therapy. Even paid for 20 hours of childcare a month.
2. Tuition Assistance was 100% while I was in. My final month in Iraq I finished my BS and walked around with a photocopy of my degree my wife sent me in my pocket. I was so proud as I was never a great student. In May 2011, I finished my MA. Only ever paid college fees and for some of my books. Left without an ounce of student debt. Furthermore, my CompTIA and CEH certifications were all paid for by the Army.
3. In 2010, I became a homeowner when I used my VA loan. No need for a down payment and my loan was at less than 3%. That's practically free money at such low interest. Instead of giving my wages to a renter, I'm earning equity.
4. I left disabled. Back and neck are messed up. I earn a pension the rest of my life for it and am entitled to VA medical care for life.

Do you love your country if you're okay that predatory student loans plagued an entire generation?

Great societies are not free. You have to invest in them. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just willfully ignorant. During the FDR and Truman administrations these were tenants.

He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.

Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.

This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.

He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.

2023-03-02,1677724292,"Explaining The Veil: Or how Destiny's Story is based on the writings of Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin","Alright folks. I'm as disappointed in Lightfall's story as the rest of you. The Veil is completely unexplained, the Radial Mast appears and disappears as a threat without fanfare, and the Neomuni are a footnote in the siege of their own city. That's all a shame, because I think underneath it all Destiny has one of the most fascinating science-fantasy stories in gaming that, for reasons unknown, the writers refuse to actually engage with regularly.

However, elements introduced here do, I think, lend some credence to a theory I've been nursing for some time about the fundamental inspiration of Destiny's Light/Dark narrative and the philosophical conversation the writers have attempted to create over the years. I think I may be able to explain satisfactorily what the Veil is, what the Radial Mast's purpose was, and what the Witness's ultimate goal will be. It starts with Jesuit priest, paleontologist, and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

Disclaimer: Any references to theology here should be taken as an exercise in philosophy filtered through the lens of Christian mythos. I'm not advocating for anything here.

Teilhard's primary work of note is his 1955 essay *The Phenomenon of Man*, which attempted to reconcile Darwin's Theory of Evolution with the Father's own Catholicism. It got him exiled to China and the book itself wasn't published until after his death, but that's beside the point. What *is* the point is that the core concepts proposed in the book share very close parallels with Destiny's concepts of Light, Dark, and the Final Shape.

The primary conceit of the book is that the evolution of mankind doesn't end with our physical bodies and the biosphere at large. It extends beyond that, a layer higher, into what he referred to as the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere), or ""sphere of reason"", a layer of the Earth constructed of thought, belief, and information. He predated it by quite a bit, but I imagine Teilhard would have looked at today's internet as a crude, primordial form of the noosphere. As human interaction, intelligence, and thought becomes more complex it will coalesce into a form of its own, a network of information that is its own living, breathing organism.

This is supported as well by the use of [egregore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore) as a concept in Season of the Haunted. Egregore isn't something made up by Bungie's writers -- it's a concept that's existed in occultism for some time. Teilhard didn't reference egregore directly, but later commentators have clearly picked up on the correlation between the ideas. An egregore (SCP fans might also be familiar with a related concept, the tulpa) is a non-physical entity made up of collective thought. It's a pretty gross reduction, but compare it to the way a meme can take on a life of its own, become its own evolving and growing self as it's passed around and iterated on by hundreds or thousands of people. Since it's a pretty out-there idea, the writers here represented it physically as a fungus, no doubt noting the similarity to a mycelium network and the way many individual fungal neurons come together into a functional whole. But Calus's egregore is actually a thoughtform. It's the living, breathing entity that is Calus-as-Emperor. Nezarec's also this -- the pieces of their body are anchor points for the *idea* of Nezarec, and he is able to live on as pure thought, invading dreams and minds. Nightmares, similarly, are essentially tulpas derived from the fears and memories of individuals exposed to the influence of Nezarec or Calus's egregore.

Does all this sound familiar? It should -- Strand isn't related to string theory, it's the gameification of this concept of the noosphere. It's the underlying ""web"" of memory and thought. Osiris (clumsily) tries to discuss this in one of his interludes, saying that Light is the manifestation of the physical energies -- electromagnetic (Arc), weak/strong nuclear (Solar), gravity (Void), etc. -- and Dark is the manifestation of these ""thought"" energies. Stasis is the complete absence of physical energy, absolute zero, gameified into ice and crystals. It's accessed through strong emotion. Strand is the ability to manipulate and interface with pure thought.

Teilhard differentiates between two forms of energy in his essay: Tangential energy, which encompasses all the physical energies, and, wait for it... Radial energy, which is spiritual energy that accumulates into a higher state such as the noosphere. Are you beginning to see where I'm going with this? The Radial Mast was named as such because it was meant to use physical energies to interface with radial energies. Which brings us to the Veil.

Now, I think it's buckwild that there was no attempt made whatsoever to describe what the Veil actually does, but based on the above this is my best guess: the Veil is, true to its name, a ""something"" that acts as a liminal space between physical reality and spiritual reality. It either is or was meant to become a hole that connects reality with the divine. I suspect the purpose of the Radial Mast was to essentially affix it to the Traveler, which is a fragment of divinity. This similarly explains its purpose to the Neomuni and the function of the CloudArk. The Veil, as a borderland between the real and the realm of thought, is what the Neomuni needed to convert their physical minds into their digital selves. It's not like Exos, where the human mind is literally mimicked by their circuitry. Their ""souls"", so to speak, were digitized because the Veil allowed them to cross through to that other side.

Finally, this brings me to the ultimate goal of the Witness. One of the most important concepts in *The Phenomenon of Man* is the [Omega Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point), the final point of unification at the end of time. It's the ultimate point of human evolution. It's compared to the ""Logos"" in Christian theology, the process by which all things are joined in Jesus Christ. If you've ever read Isaac Asimov's phenomenal short story [The Last Question](https://xpressenglish.com/our-stories/the-last-question/), the artificial intelligence AC at the heat death of the universe is the Omega Point. You could call it... the Final Shape.

Destiny has since its very beginning flirted with the concept of divinity, ascension, and apotheosis. Guardians are considered gods on earth. The Sol Divisive's search for God through the Darkness. The Sword Logic is the process by which the Hive become divine, with the Worm Gods even higher above them. The Traveler and the Witness both are treated as even higher divinities. The story of all these heroes and villains are various journeys towards ever greater layers of divinity. This isn't new to Bungie either -- Marathon was the story of AIs outgrowing their bounds and becoming godlike in their power, and even Cortana does this in the later Halo games. 

The Final Shape -- the Omega Point -- is the idea of the true, final, absolute highest divinity. Frequently people refer to the Vex as being the Final Shape in other universes, but they were only the Final Shape *within the boundaries of that universe*. The Witness is seeking the actual Final Shape, King of Kings -- they want to dethrone the Winnower and the Gardener, who set everything in motion, and become the actual end of all things. That, I believe, is where the door in the Traveler leads -- beyond the concept of ""reality"" itself, to the home of real gods. 

But we know something the Witness doesn't: this is all a game, and there is a divinity even higher than the Winnower and the Gardener. Us, and, by transference, our Guardians.

\-----------------------------------------------

tl;dr:

* Light is Teilhard's tangential energy, Dark is his radial energy.
* Nezarec is an egregore, Nightmares are tulpas created from their influence. Calus's egregore was literally the non-physical manifestation of his giant fucking ego.
* Strand isn't string theory, it's the ability to interact with the noosphere, aka the collective consciousness of all living things. Stasis is the complete absence of physical energy.
* The Veil is either an object or a point in space where the boundary between the physical and spiritual realities is thinnest. This is what let the Neomuni essentially digitize their consciousness and their souls.
* The Radial Mast was meant to connect physical (tangential) reality to spiritual (radial) reality, using the Veil as a tunnel between them. The Traveler was required because it is the being closest to God in the Destiny universe that we're playing in.
* The Final Shape is another way of saying the Omega Point. The Witness wants to bring about the actual Omega Point across all realities, and thus is invading the realm of the Winnower and the Gardener, whatever they are, to end them. That is where the portal in the Traveler leads.
* Unfortunately, Guardians, by virtue of being controlled by us players, are an even higher form of divinity than the Winnower/Gardener.
* The entire story of Lightfall is a total filler episode that was probably supposed to be like one mission before Final Shape was split in two
* Ngl pretty sad that the very interesting villain that was Calus got turned into just another dude and killed off without exploring any of the mega cool stuff from Haunted
* Boy howdy SURE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE if any of this, if true, was said at any point in the story :\^)
* pass the copium
* EDIT: Is it just a coincidence that Neomuna sounds an awful lot like noumena...?

2023-02-26,1677380843,"The Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team scored almost as many points today as the football team's offense did the entire 2022 season.","Today, Iowa defeated Michigan State 112-106 in overtime. I didn't see it, but it must have been an insane game. We all know how sad and inept the Hawkeyes were on offense this past season, and it seems their basketball team is an exact opposite. 112 is a very high total for basketball, and I was wondering if they outscored the football team's offense.

So let see who scored more. Iowa offense (football) the entire season, or Iowa offense (basketball) in this single game.

Keep in mind that a large part of Iowa's success last year came from defense and special teams. I am considering field goals and extra points as special teams points. The target is Iowa basketball's total today, **112**

Game 1, South Dakota State: 0 points on offense. They won from a field goal and two safeties.

Game 2, Iowa State: 6 points on offense. One touchdown.

Game 3, Nevada: 18 points on offense. Three touchdowns.

Game 4, Rutgers: 6 points on offense. One touchdown, but the defense scored twice

Game 5, Michigan: 12 points on offense. Seriously, Michigan, how did they score against you?

Game 6, Illinois: 0 points on offense in a game that featured only field goals

Game 7, Ohio State: 0 points on offense, but they got a neat scoop and score

Game 8, Northwestern: 18 points on offense. Unfortunately NU was so bad last year they let Iowa explode like a volcano against them for three touchdowns.

Game 9, Purdue: 18 points on offense. At think at this point in the season Brian Ferentz figured some things out.

Game 10, Wisconsin: 12 points on offense. The two touchdowns were accompanied by an interception return for a TD

Game 11, Minnesota: 6 points on offense

Game 12, Nebraska: 12 points on offense

Bowl Game, Kentucky: 6 points on offense, and their defense helped the offense with two scores of their own, without allowing Kentucky to score at all!

I was hoping this would be a funny Reddit post but unfortunately it seems that I have wasted my time, as Iowa's offense scored **114** points worth of touchdowns in 2022, and did manage to outscore the basketball team's performance today by 2 points. However, if you selectively change the statistical qualifier to say *regular season,* then Iowa's basketball team *did* outscore their football team's season-long offensive output today.","CFB",67,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/11c3s71/the_iowa_hawkeyes_mens_basketball_team_scored/"

2023-02-12,1676175420,"Project Blue Beam - Everything You Need To Know (The Definitive Guide to PBB regarding US, Alaskan and Canadian UFO's and Chinese Surveillance Balloons in 2023)","In this post I will explain [Project Blue Beam](https://www.projectbluebeamtheory.com) : where it started, what it is, and where we stand with it now. Many theorists call it the **'fake alien invasion'** that is being planned by the elites in an attempt to produce a final **one-world government.** In this post I will explain the origination of the theory and where we stand with it today. Many of it seems crazy, some of it, not so crazy. Please allow me to explain.

Everything in this post is as objective as possible and I have done my best to avoid speculating and stick as closely as possible to the truth. Please be aware that I am not trying to push this theory as being 100% true, but rather to explain to people exactly what it is, why the theory holds weight and why things that are happening right now, do seem to support the theory.

The theory these days tends to be held as a theory of the elite planning to produce a one-world government through the efforts of a fake-alien invasion. The fake-alien invasion is assumed to bring the worlds governments together fighting one common enemy (the aliens) which will finally end in the defeat of the enemy and the unification of the one-world government. But the original theory is much more complicated and elaborate than that... so I will explain everything in detail.

**Project Blue Beam** is a conspiracy theory which was theorised in the 80s and 90s that NASA (or another covert government-related agency) has been planning to implement a **New-Age religion** with the **Anti-Christ** as the leader - and to start a New World Order via a technologically-simulated Second-Coming **using holograms.** The allegations were first theorised in 1994 by journalist Serge Monast and later published in his book *(which is now almost impossible to obtain).*

The book was called *Project Blue Beam (NASA)* and supporters of the theory allege that Monast and another unnamed journalist, who both died of heart attacks in 1996, were in fact assassinated, and that the Canadian government kidnapped Monast's daughter in an effort to stop him from investigating Project Blue Beam.

In the early 1990s, Monast spoke to the French TV host, Richard Glenn, of *Ésotérisme Expérimental* and he explained his theory, **Project Blue Beam:**

* It explains how events that were happening at the time, particularly films being made *(Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc)* were being used to prepare people psychologically for the conspiracy's dramatic conclusion. **A fake alien invasion.**
* It originally played on fears of alleged advanced technology that most people at the time, including its author, did not understand. Although now, **30 years later in 2023**, we can fully comprehend.

The theorist's death from **a supposed middle-age heart attack (although perfectly healthy)** cut off its possible spread early and left it short on source-material in English (since the author was French and the internet was not available - people could not translate and share the theory.. until now..)

If we look deeper into the theory today, we realise that a lot of what he said does seem to make sense, whilst some of it seems absurd. Allow me to elaborate:

**Propogation:**

The theory was widely popular in the 90s, with many web pages in the 00s dedicated to the subject and countless Youtube videos explaining it (which have now unsurprisingly mostly been censored by Google and YouTube).

Monast lectured on the theory in the mid-1990s (a transcript of one such lecture is available with enough digging), before writing and publishing his book, which has not been reissued by his current publisher and is extremely hard to find. However, a three-page summary of the theory, apparently penned by Monast himself, appeared in his French-language periodical *RINF* (*Réseau international de nouvelles par fax*) at the end of 1994. The scarce pages and videos all appear to trace back to four documents:

* A transcript of the 1994 lecture by Monast, translated into English.
* A GeoCities page written by David Openheimer which appears to elaborate on the theories from the original book.
* A page on educate-yourself.org compiled in 2005, which appears to include a translation of the book from French.
* Monast's page in French Wikipedia. (The French Wikipedia article is largely sourced from two books on conspiracy theories and extremism by Pierre-André Taguieff, a mainstream academic expert on racist and extremist groups.)

From these few texts have come multiple off-shoot theories in text and video form, in several languages which people still refer to to this day. But here I will try my best to stick to the truth as much as possible. As with a lot of these things, a theory before it has happened is merely a theory. Before 9/11 happened, people theorised of a large terrorist event that would involve the deaths of thousands of people, happening in or around NYC. This post will serve in that similar detail, that it is merely a **theory** for the time being, until future events can ultimately prove it.

But, regardless if it is true or not, the text following is extremely strange and will make anyone with a conscious mind shudder:

*Beyond a Pale Horse, William Coopers* book from 1991, has recently been considered to be a prophecy regarding *Project Blue Beam* to be used in the future as a reference to PBB build-up:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It is true that without the population or the bomb problem the elect would use some other excuse to bring about the New World Order. They have plans to bring about things like **earthquakes, war,** the **Messiah**, an **extra-terrestrial landing**, and **economic collapse**. They might bring about all of these things just to make damn sure that it does work. They will do whatever is necessary to succeed. The Illuminati has all the bases covered and you are going to have to be on your toes to make it through the coming years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Can you imagine what will happen if **Los Angeles is hit** with a 9.0 **\[earth\]quake**, **New York City is destroyed** by a **terrorist**\-planted atomic **bomb \[9/11\]**, **World War III breaks out in the Middle East \[Western Invasion\],** the **banks and the stock markets collapse \[20/01/23\]**, **Extra-terrestrials land on the White House lawn \[PBB\]**, **food disappears from the markets \[COVID\]** , some **people disappear \[Died Suddenly\]**, the **Messiah presents himself to the world \[PBB\]**, and all in a very short period of time? Can you imagine? The world power structure can, and will if necessary, make some or all of those things happen to bring about the **New World Order.**

**The Theory**

The alleged purpose of **Project Blue Beam** is to bring about a global **New Age religion**, which is seen as a core requirement for the NWO's dictatorship to be realized.

Monast's theory suggests using advanced technology to trick people into believing in the New Age religion.

Like I have already mentioned, much of this seems impossible, but now - not so impossible.

The project has four steps:

**Step One**

Step One requires the breakdown of all archaeological knowledge. This will apparently be accomplished by **FAKING EARTHQUAKES \[multiple earthquakes, 2023\]** at precise locations around the planet. These earthquakes will with them eventually present new information which will make us question our current belief-systems in regards to religion.

**As most of you reading this will be aware, there have been multiple earthquakes recently,** ***all of which*** **seem to be happening at a much more frequent rate than usual. If PBB is correct, soon we will hear some sort of revelation in regards to new information coming to light regarding religious doctrine. Or perhaps it will be supressed...**

**Step Two**

This is where it gets a bit crazy.

Airspace holograms will start off as subtle UFO but will eventually appear to people as ***their God.***

This involves a large-scale hologram show where three-dimensional holographic laser projections will be beamed all over the planet  and this is where Blue Beam *really* starts. The projections will take the shape of ***whatever deity is most predominant***, and will speak in all languages. *(Jesus in the US, Allah in the Middle East, etc)* At the end of this show, the gods will all merge into one god, the Antichrist. This will be the start of the New-Age religion.

Yes, I know, it seems crazy - stick with me. If you believe it's possible - read on. If you don't, then still read on, you'll learn something...

The notion of gods being projected into the sky was actually proposed before, in 1991 by conspiracy theorist Betty J. Mills And US general (CIA operative) Edward Landsdale, who actually suggested a plan to fake a Second Coming over Cuba... to get rid of Castro.

Consider the apparent tests over the years,

The **Chinese hologram of a flying city** 9/10/15.

The **green beams in Milton Keynes**, UK 25/11/20

The **Queens hologram** 05/06/22.

These all seem like possible staged events to test public reaction leading up to PBB. There are many more if you look hard enough - either way, it's apparent.. we now have the tech for convincing holograms to be projected into the sky and they're projecting convincing holograms into the sky.. if anyone was ever going to suggest PBB is happening, now would definitely be the time.

Airspace holograms are definitely not unfathomable anymore..

**Step Three**

Step Three is ""Telepathic Electronic Two-Way Communication"". It involves making people think their god is speaking to them through telepathy, projected into the head of each person individually using radio waves.

With all the advances in technology today with regards to Elon Musk's brain-chip 'Neuralink' - this definitely seems more fathomable. In the coming years, Neuralink will be implemented, and this will make it much easier for the 'telepathic electronic two-way communication'  - the exact same communication that Monast was speaking of in the 90s but that no one understood...

But now, yes - it can *definitely* be understood..

**Step Four**

Step Four has three parts:

1. Making humanity think an alien invasion is about to occur in every major city (which seems to have already started)
2. Making the Christians think that the Rapture is about to happen (which also seems to have started)
3. A mixture of electronic and supernatural forces, allowing the supernatural forces to travel through **fibre optics, coax, power, and telephone lines** to penetrate all electronic equipment and appliances that will, by now, 2023, all have a special microchip installed **(5G).**

Then chaos will break out, and people will finally be willing, perhaps even desperate, **to accept the New World Order.**

Project Blue Beam supporters believe psychological preparations have already been made, as previously mentioned in this post, Monast claimed that the films ''***2001: A Space Odyssey'***, '***Star Wars'***, and the '***Star Trek'*** series all involve an invasion from space which ends ultimately in the coming together of countries to fight the common enemy **(the fake alien invasion) also known as PBB.**

This theory can also be further supported by the many recent films and series involving alien interference and invasion, *especially in the recent years between 10-23.*

(Step Five - New World Order. See Bush SR's quote at the end of this post....)

**The Prophecy**

Joel Engel's book *Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek* explains of an **unmade Star Trek film** that seems to prophesise Project Blue Beam...

**""In May 1975, Gene Roddenberry accepted an offer from Paramount to develop Star Trek into a feature film, and moved back into his old office on the Paramount lot. His proposed story told of a flying saucer, hovering above Earth, that was programmed to send down people who looked like prophets, including Jesus Christ.""**

So, it turns out that the basis of the conspiracy theory was in the **UNMADE mid-'70s** ***Star Trek*** **film script by Roddenberry,** which were recycled for the *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episode *Devil's Due*, broadcast in 1991 in which the false prophets had been redacted from the plot.

In addition, believe it or not, Gene Roddenberry **used to work for U.S military intelligence....**

**In Conclusion:**

There is no evidence of deliberate fraud on Monast's part so how did he know exactly what the film script prophesised? The actual source was so obviously similar that even other conspiracy theorists noticed. They assumed that it was obvious that Monast had been fed information from the CIA, hence his apparent assassination in the 90's... This part of the story is very strange and no one is yet to come up with a credible theory as to why this happened, or how it happened.

So, how did this happen? Coincidence? Or the Illuminati doing what they're so good at doing? Prophesising events ***before they even happen?*** I think we all know, perhaps much too well, how this has happened before...

I will now break down the worlds current events which could certainly be used to support Monasts theory from the 90s, and not only explain the following events in the 00s and 10s but also explain the events of the 20s and most importantly, 2023...

**Recent Events**

**00s and 10s:**

Multiple UFO sightings by the general public, ***not covered by MSM.***

**2021 &amp; 2022:**

A steady release of information from multiple MSM sources worldwide re UFO's, ***covered by MSM.***

The media start gradually drip-feeding us more information, accepting the fact that aliens \[may\] exist and that ***Roswell and Area 54 was real.***

Joe Rogan and Netflix etc push the narrative of 'Tic Tac' UFO's - and that there are ***definitely UFO's in our airspace - even supported by Obama.***

**Jan 28th 2023 (event #1, #2 &amp; #3)**

A Chinese-operated, large white high-altitude 'surveillance balloon' was seen in North American airspace **(event #1) including Alaska (event #2) , western Canada (event #3),** and the contiguous **United States,** whilst in Hawaii, a giant wall of green lasers appeared to be shooting down from the sky.

**Feb 4th 2023:**

The Chinese 'surveillance balloon' is eventually shot down in US airspace **(see event #1)**

**Feb 10th 2023:**

The US shoot down an ""unidentified object"" **over Alaska (see event #2).** (Described as cylindrical and grey in appearance.)

**Feb 11th 2023:**

NORAD shoot down a 2nd ""unidentified object"" **over Canada (see event #3).** (Described as flying, but the shape of a car.)

**Feb 12th 2023:**

US shoots down a 3rd ""unidentified object"" over Lake Heron.

**3 UFO's shot down in 3 days.....**

**Is the start of PBB upon us?**

So, based on our current knowledge, PBB is not proven, but has definitely been reinforced. There are multiple happenings which have not only been prophesised by PBB documentation, but that definitely seem to demonstrate and back it up. Are these merely coincidences? Or is something deeper afoot?

Personally I believe that there is some truth in the theory, but the idea of prophets being projected into the sky seems to be outlandish. Is the truth more subtle? Will we experience holograms which will later be proved to simply be UFO's? Followed by aliens who claim to be Messiahs? What do you think is possibly going on?

I believe there is more to PBB than just being a crazy theory detailed by a Frenchman in the 90s - I  certainly believe there is more to it. Projected Messiahs? I'm not so sure. But the recent happenings would definitely suggest something is going on. Exactly what? Only time will tell.

I suppose we will only find out the truth in due course. Thank you for reading, and I appreciate any input you may have.

Yours,

Below is a clip of Bush SR on September 11th 1991 referring to an event in which all nations will be drawn together in an effort to defeat one common enemy (took me ages to find) Many conspiracy theorists assume this is a reference to PBB, the **'fake alien invasion'** \- and it's hard to consider another scenario he could be referencing. **'All nations drawn together to defeat a common enemy' ??**

A very strange speech, for sure... (0:33)

""What is at stake, is more than one small country - it is a big idea - a **New World Order** where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause.. to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind - peace and security, freedom and the rule of law.. out of these humble times, **our fifth objective \[Step Five?\] - the New World Order** \- can emerge, \[and\] now we can see a new world coming into view.

The next enemy was asteroids. Now, at this point he kind of chuckled the first time he said it. **Asteroids**\- against **ASTEROIDS** we are going to build space-based weapons.

And the funniest one of all was what he called aliens, extraterrestrials. That would be the final scare. And over and over and over during the four years that I knew him and was giving speeches for him, he would bring up that last card. **""And remember Carol, the last card is the alien card.

2023-02-27,1677535924,"Regarding the Situation with LadyFiszi","**UPDATE:** Scott Cawthon has commented the following

&gt; Hey everyone, I won't write much about this here, but I will say that LadyFiszi no longer does artwork for Five Nights at Freddy's. Sexual scenarios involving children are disgusting and grotesque in any form, including fan art and fan fiction, and have no place in the Five Nights at Freddy's universe. It is my understanding that she regrets this time in her life, and I wish her the best going forward.


**Why are we making this post:**

As of late, more and more information surrounding her has to come to light, both old and new. Which has led to LadyFiszi even making a few posts addressing them.
With many users understandably being misinformed on the matter with many misconceptions being spread around, the most popular of which being that she was fired or having stuff she did mixed up with other artists. We'd like to take a moment and discuss a handful of the major examples, so people are more aware of what's going on. 

**CW/TW** This post will have content that users may find deeply disturbing. We the mod team want to give this warning as we know this is very serious and dark material but we also need to let users know about this. The subject matter in this post is the following; sexual violence, child endangerment, gore, abuse, Transmisia, vulgar language, Pedophilia, and Ableism.


**Who is LadyFiszi:**

LadyFiszi started off as a popular fan artist who would post their own pieces of fanfiction and artwork across various platforms such as Reddit and DeviantArt. Nowadays you might recognize them most as one of the main freelance artists Scott has contacted in the past to work on various pieces of media for the franchise:

- The Twisted Animatronic designs, Twisted Freddy poster, and Scottgames.com teasers for The Twisted Ones, as well the poster included with the novel trilogy bundle based on The Fourth Closet.

- The original artwork created for The Freddy Files trilogy, pieces for The Survival Logbook, and mostly recently a handful of original assets for The Character Encyclopedia.

- The covers for all of the Fazbear Frights books, the Fazbear Frights Graphic Novel Collections, and the first few Tales from the Pizzaplex covers.

- and most importantly, various assets for Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, Ultimate Custom Night, Freddy in Space 2, and Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach.


**Transphobic comments:**

**On 5/8/2019**, [This was the date when the first well known instance of LadyFiszi making a transphobic remark occured.](https://lm.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/blzosc/do_not_praise_rebornicas_return/emt6my3/?context=3) LadyFiszi commented on a post criticizing the return of fan artist Rebornica, where in her initial comment referred to them as a creature and said they were a she despite knowing they wanted to be referred to as ""they"".

**On 2/28/2020**, a post was made on the subreddit containing artwork of Mangle titled ""We love our canonically genderfluid character :D"", [LadyFiszi posted a comment saying ""Nah, please no, it's a robot."" and what happened from there was an argument between her and OP.](https://reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/falrmp/we_love_our_canonically_genderfluid_character_d/fizz16h/?context=3)

This led to responses consisting of her calling people's genders ""nonsense"", saying they just ""make up genders to be unique"", and calling other users ""easy-to-trigger"" to name a few examples. They were banned for a period of time following this.

**On 7/30/2020**, During this time various users on the subreddit were making several posts calling out LadyFiszi for her past actions. As a result, the moderator team personally reached out to LadyFiszi asking if she could release a statement on the matter via a comment or post clearing them, explaining if they reflect the person she is today or just simply going more in-depth them clarifying the matter at hand. Unfortunately we never received a response back from her.

**On 9/28/2020**, [LadyFiszi made a post on the subreddit simply titled ""Apology"".](https://lm.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/j197fe/apology/) In the post, she starts off by stating she originally didn't want to make the post because it felt like giving into the haters, [but after a discussion with GBAura-Recharged (who has since then expressed regret for supporting them, even before recent events transpired)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/1138m02/comment/j8pe52o/), realized it was for the innocent people who she feels she hurt with her ignorance and denial.

She then goes on to say she made ignorant and uneducated comments about gender identities and trans people, and wanted to make it clear she doesn't hate trans people. She then goes on to say that part of the reason for her comments was because of cultural differences, stating that trans people aren't common in Hungary. She then mentions that at the time she had no idea why it was a big deal, but then had it explained to her and realized what she said wasn't ok.

She then follows it up by mentioning that she was in a really bad state at the time she said those things in regards to her mental and psychical health. Bringing up the fact she's had Crohn's disease for 14 years at the time of writing the post as an example and how it messed her up both emotionally and mentally.

**The Fanfiction:**

As stated before, LadyFiszi created her own Five Nights at Freddy's fanfiction which was about her own take on the Missing Children Incident and feature her own take on the Purple Guy, known as Barney Miles.

The fanfiction is quite controversial due to the portrayal of Purple Guy and how his scenes were written, with the most popular example being Betty's death where it consists of grotesque imagery and goes into great detail about the murder and sexual assault of her.

**On 9/28/2020**, LadyFiszi did briefly address it in her post titled ""Apology"". She starts off by mentioning that she had received death threats over the fanfiction that she wrote many years ago. She states she was a different person back then and couldn't finish the story because of her thoughts on how she saw the characters had changed because of stuff that occured in her personal life. I don't remember the exact details (I don't usually reread my stuff, being stories, journals or comments), She then says she doesn't remember the exact details as she doesn't usually reread her own stuff but then admits she got carried away showing how twisted her version of the Purple Guy is. She lastly states it had some sexual undertones, but that there were no actual scenes where Purple Guy molests a child. Ending it off saying that it would be a very different story if she wrote it today.

**On 2/13/2023**, LadyFiszi addressed it again in her post ""Seems like I'm a ped0 n4zi now"" as a response to people calling her a pedophile. She starts off by saying she's absolutely angry at the people who call her that. Then follows it up with saying that she wrote a fanfiction of a man who was canonically a child serial killer, and used her knowledge in crime novels to create the murderers motives and personality. She then states this went a bit overboard, however this was during her edgy phase so she didn't see it as much. Afterwards she states that murderer men do feel power and arousal when they kill, and they love it. She then ends off post saying that some can't differentiate fiction from reality.

----

Another aspect of the fanfiction there's been frequent discussions about related to it is speculation that the fanfiction might have had influence on the main franchise.

- [Screenshots from an exchange between a deviantart user and LadyFiszi from 2016 has Fiszi expressed interest in sharing the fanfiction with Scott.](https://i.imgur.com/aVD3Aku.png)

- There has also been speculation that there have been references to it in official media, such as the Lore and Theories Purple Guy art resembling previous work she had done of her AU design, [as well as a children's poster in a calendar that was released that appears to share similarities with a scene and art made for the fanfiction.](https://i.imgur.com/nBecuUR.png) 

It's unclear if the Lore and Theories design similarities are intentional or coincidences, [however LadyFiszi in the comments of a post on DeviantArt did confirm that the poster in the calendar was an intentional reference to Betty and Scott gave her the ok to include it.](https://www.deviantart.com/ladyfiszi/journal/New-FNAF-merch-is-coming-664137463)

**DeviantArt Groups she was apart of:**

**On 1/23/2023**, [a twitter user posted information regarding LadyFiszi's DeviantArt account.](https://twitter.com/IronAidanD/status/1617065498671202304?s=20) Pointing out that she was in the following groups: Fascionism, BEASTS-OF-WAR, and Uniform-Fetish. In the post, they included artwork she had done of Nazis, also stating there was another one but they didn't post it as it was too vulgar. 

**On 2/13/2023**, [LadyFiszi made a post on her DeviantArt account titled ""Seems like I'm a ped0 n4zi now"" where she discussed it.](https://www.deviantart.com/ladyfiszi/journal/Seems-like-I-m-a-ped0-n4zi-now-949370810) She stated that she did join those groups, however that was 15 years ago when she was 18-20 years old and had just discovered anime/manga. She states that Hellsing was one of the few mangas available in her language and that she really liked it. She then states she was super edgy back then, this was during her edgy phase which lasted from 18-25 years old, and that she looked up everything to do it with it. Then saying it took her years to realize Nazis weren't edgy and that she had forgotten about the groups she had joined and was too lazy to look them up. She then ends the post by telling the person who discovered the information to ""get a life, lowlife""

**On 2/26/2023**, it was reported that LadyFiszi had left 61 deviantart groups including the ones from before.

**Grooming Allegations:**

**On 2/22/2023**, [@HenrySpktr made a post on twitter where they included a supposive overview of their experience with LadyFiszi, a list of key things that Fiszi did during their interactions, and overall stating that they were groomed and manipulated as a minor by her.](https://i.imgur.com/UCmJtgR.jpg)

Unfortunately at the time of this writing, they have not provided any receipts of the events that occurred nor have they responded to anyone asking for screenshots of their interactions. As of now, their account is currently privated. As a result, there's currently no way to verify their story and to corroborate with any of their claims.

**On 2/23/2023**, [LadyFiszi briefly discussed the allegations in a post on her DeviantArt account titled ""My evil anime list LOL"".](https://www.deviantart.com/ladyfiszi/journal/My-evil-anime-list-LOL-950797862) She stated she did not know who the person was, that it was defamation, and that she asked one person to edit her fanfic and she know who they were and it was not them.

**On 2/24/2023**, [LadyFiszi made another post titled ""I'm done with the stupids"", further discussing the allegations because she had gotten bored and tired of them.](https://www.deviantart.com/ladyfiszi/journal/I-m-done-with-the-stupids-950931234) In the post, she asks the reader what would she do with children, given that she's an asexual CIS woman. She then proceeds to state she doesn't care about the people coming after her anymore, that people need to not believe everything they read on the internet and to differentiate between fiction and reality. Then insists the people who focus on her alleged child sexualization are the real creep, and that they need a life. Ending the post with a link to the person who accused her.


**Miscellaneous**:

**The List)**

**On 2/23/2023**, she made a post on her DeviantArt account titled ""My evil anime list LOL"" where she addressed a list that she stated that people were using to claim she liked lolicon and shotacon. Fiszi then states it was actually a wordlist she made at age 20 with her friends for a university project which consisted of a list of anime/manga words. She then links the original post and tells people to read the comments and learn some Hungarian before you immediately judge her.

However people who have checked the thread with google translate have reported that there were no mention of school or university, and that one comment alludes to the idea it might have been a prompt project in which people would submit art for them.

**Tracing Allegations)**

As mentioned at the start of the post, people have mixed up the various artists involved with this series and their actions. One popular example is people frequently mistake various cases of fan art and artwork for official media that were supposedly traced as something that LadyFiszi did despite these instances being done by other artists. 

However despite that, there were legitimate allegations thrown at LadyFiszi back in 2016 in regards to several pieces of fan art she had created being traced. With the aftermath being many of the comments on her artwork being marked as hidden and the descriptions being edited to include the following text: [""edit: Okay, since KryptoniteDarkKnight was really forcing this, I admit: I TRACED THIS IMAGES!!! IT'S NOT ORIGINAL!!!""](https://www.deviantart.com/ladyfiszi/art/FNAF-2-toy-animatronics-596860991)

**Interactions with @Frebb0)**

**On 2/23/2023**, [Twitter user @Frebb0 posted several screenshots of interactions between her and LadyFiszi that occured on DeviantArt from back in 2016](https://twitter.com/Frebb0/status/1628971401427275776), pointing out statements they felt came off as transphobic and a case of ableism.

Later that same day, [they made another post containing screenshots from a discussion about Barney's arousement of child murder and contains mention of rape.](https://twitter.com/Frebb0/status/1628974651803111428/photo/1)

**On 2/25/2023**, LadyFiszi posted a reply on her post ""I'm done with the stupids"" where she addressed the prior screenshots. She states she did in fact have those conversations about Barney's arousement of the child murders with Frebb0, stating that Frebb0 was the one who brought it up. Fiszi then states she knew that Frebb0 was young and that she shouldn't have talked about it. Fiszi was so excited about the fact that young people were reading her stuff that she answered the questions. At first the story was marked was mature and age restricted however she removed it because of greed and stated she wanted more likes. She ends with saying it was a big mistake however there's nothing she can do 6-7 years later.

Please note: In regards to Fiszi's claim that Frebb0 started the discussion, Frebb0 has denied such claims.


**Conclusion:**

All in all, we'd like for you all to come to your own conclusion on the matter. This thread will be the only place in which discussion of the matter will be allowed at this current time, however please remember to keep the guidelines in mind when posting a comment. Make sure to be respectful and civil to people even if you strongly disagree with them on a matter.

We also ask that you do not reach out to, stalk, or harass ANYONE mentioned or included in this post. Many of the people who came forward with their stories involving LadyFiszi wanted to move on from these experiences, and we're only mentioning these here for transparency.

As of now LadyFiszi is banned from the subreddit and there are no plans to unban her at this time.

She has patches of light discoloration on her face and the left side of her buttocks as the result of eczema. Teekah has facial dimples, and pierced ears. Some reports say that Teekah had a silver streak on the right front section of her hair. It is unclear if this was a dyed section or a natural section of gray hair, although I would assume it was natural.

She was wearing a green Tweety Bird sweatshirt or t-shirt, white sweatpants and black and white Air Jordan sneakers, with her hair pulled into ponytails. She was carrying a clear purse with a fish design, containing Starburst candies. Teekah had eczema and also suffered from asthma at the time she went missing. She used an inhaler.

Diamonds nephew King Walker was being babysat by his grandmother, LaShann, for the day while his mother was at a class in Chicago. Meanwhile, Eugene was at work. King went down for a nap in the mid morning hours as did Diamond. Later LaShann fell asleep on the couch. When she awoke, she learned that Diamond and King were both gone. She assumed that the pair had gone on a walk or had walked to a nearby store, but when LaShann went outside, she couldnt find them. She called Eugene to leave work to search the area but he was unable to locate his daughter and grandson. It is believed that King woke from his nap and wanted to go outside, so Diamond followed him and then either the pair got lost or met with foul play. The family had recently moved to Gary from Hammond Indiana.

**Diamond** is described as a black female 48 in height who weighed 240 lbs. She was 21 in 2015. She has black hair with dyed golden highlights. She is bow legged and walks with a limp and one arm bent. Her teeth are described as crooked. She takes medication for her condition but she doesnt have her medication with her. When last seen she was wearing a white top and either blue or purple pants which may have been made of denim material.

**King** is described as a 2 year old black male. He was 3'0 in height and 34 pounds in 2015. He was last seen wearing a blue t-shirt and red shorts. He has black hair styled in dreadlocks and brown eyes. In the past his hair has also been styled into braids.

Two year old **Wallace Guidroz** went to the park with his father Stanley Guidroz one winter day in Tacoma, Washingtons Point Defiance park in March, 1980. Stanley claimed that a couple with a young girl abducted Wallace when he went for a walk.

Wallace is described as a biracial male, Korean and African American. He may also have some white ancestry. When he was last seen, he was almost 3 years old and was 30 in height and 35 lbs. He was wearing purple corduroy overalls, a dark blue vest, a dark blue down jacket with a red collar, a gray knitted skullcap, and cowboy boots.

**Debra Anne Honey Hooks** and **Danielle Mouton** both went missing from the Puyallup Avenue area of Tacoma albeit years apart. Debra, sadly turned to sex work after addiction caused her to lose her family, her home, and her job. Debra is described as either a biracial (Caucasian, African American) or multi racial (Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic) female, 41 years old with brown eyes and blonde hair. Some reports say it was dyed that color from brown. Honey-Hooks may use her last names together or separately. Her ears are pierced. When she went missing in 2002, she was 57 and weighed about 80 lbs.

**Danielle Mouton**, also a sex worker, was bubbly with lots of friends. She was working on maintaining custody of her daughter when she suddenly vanished in 2010. Danielle is described as a black female, 54 or 55 in height and weighing 140-175 lbs. She has black curly hair and brown eyes. When she was last seen she was wearing a black blouse, a rust-colored jacket, green slacks, rust-colored wooden shoes and a designer Cartier watch with a black wristband. She has the words ""Marmar"" and ""Lady Koko"" tattooed on her upper left arm. Danielle was known to use drugs in the past, but it is unknown if she was using at the time of her disappearance.

**Spokane, 2007 John Doe:** In June of 2007, a passerby noticed a body floating in the Spokane River just east of the Washington Street Bridge in the city of Spokane. The body was badly decomposed and had been dead 1 to 6 months before discovery. The cause of death is not known. The man was determined to be approximately 5 3 to 5 6 probably weighing 130-180 lbs. in life. This victim's body did not have any tattoos, but not all of his skin was present. His fingerprints could not be obtained. This man was only wearing one tattered sock made of wool like material. And one shoe men's size 5 or 6. There's no description of the shoe or sock.

When this victim was discovered, he had only one remaining tooth. In life the man had suffered earlier (healed) trauma to his jaw, nose, and orbital bone. This traumatic injury would have left him with some scarring and possible facial deformities; he may have had an underbite that would have been noticeable. He most likely had a scar over his left eyebrow. His nose has been broken in the past, and his jaw had been surgically repaired with two titanium Walter Lorenz brand plates. By 2007 these plates were no longer being made, and it appears that the man had had jaw surgery 2 to 5 years prior to his death. It is possible all three injuries occurred at the same time from something such as a car accident. It is possible the man lost his teeth in this incident, but the medical examiner also noted that the teeth could have been lost before or after the trauma to the face occurred. And it is even possible that he lost his teeth during decomposition after death, meaning in life this man may have had teeth. The corpse also had signs of gum disease, and black head hair three quarters of an inch long with no gray present.

This man's race and age have been disputed over the years. His age has been estimated as anywhere between 33 and 55, with the general consensus being that the man is about 40 years old. An examination of the skull showed that the man was white or Caucasian, but his hair is classified as negroid hair. Because of this many have speculated that the man was biracial or mixed race, most likely a combination of white and black heritage. This man is not Jose Rodriguez Hernandez, Joe Pichler, John Baker, George McDonald, William Downey, Shawn Houston, Anthony Sam, Alvin Matlock, George Pooler, or Alfred Grimes. Thankfully dental charts and DNA are available for comparison to this unidentified victim whose reconstruction can be viewed [here.](http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/734umwa.html)

I have submitted two men as potential matches to this doe. **Stanley Gene Chandler, and James Natalia Foster.** Foster disappeared from Steilacoom, Washington in the late 1980s at age 19. Very little is known about his disappearance and he may be living as a transient. I suggested him as a possibility for this doe- although it is a long shot. Chandler on the other hand, disappeared from Seattle in 1990 at age 23. Meaning he would have been 40 in 2006 or 2007. Most notably, both Chandler and the unidentified man both had a noticeable scar over their left eyebrow, and both men were only 54 in height. Both of these missing men are listed as being black, while the unidentified man is reported to be biracial. I decided there were enough similarities between the cases that they deserved to be submitted, even if they are not matches. I heard back from the Doe Network who informed me that Chandler has previously been submitted, but he has not been ruled out yet. Foster had never been.

**Toni Clark** went missing in 1990 when she was only 17 years old and about 2 months pregnant, on or near the Golden Gate Bridge. She was a star swimmer and track athlete at school. A write up on the case can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/6f1i1p/missing_and_forgotten_toni_danieelle_clark/)

When I initially wrote about this case, little information was available but most sources reported that Toni was driving her boyfriend's car, a Chevy Camaro, which had been having issues as of late. The car stalled on the bridge a few minutes before midnight and a woman (Presumably Toni) was seen looking under the hood. At 12 am, another car rear ended Toni's car but when emergency services arrived at 12:06 am there was no sign of Toni. Reports stated that witnesses saw a woman fly into the bay, which was searched to no avail. The driver was then tried for manslaughter but was acquitted as there was no proof Toni was actually dead.

However, in the last few years, articles tell a different story. According to new reports, while people saw Toni standing in front of her stalled car, no one observed her fall into the bay. Moreover, there was no blood or hair found inside Toni's vehicle, but her bracelet which she never removed was found on the floor of the passenger seat. Witnesses also reported that an African American man was looking under Toni's car at one point and other witnesses saw an African American man leaving the scene of the accident. Toni's mother received a call from an unknown girl crying about a week after Toni's disappearance and believes it may have been Toni. She is still classified as a missing person.

2023-02-17,1676655972,"Inexplicable Blindness: The Terrifying Story of Jordyn Walkers Medical Mystery (Mysterious Missouri #17)","**Introduction**

On December 12, 2018, 15-year-old Jordyn Walker began to complain of a tooth ache and an unstoppable runny nose. For most parents and teenagers, such symptoms would seem more like an inconvenience than anything else. For Walker and her family, it was cause for significant alarm because they remembered what had happened a year earlier, a scary stint in the hospital that had begun in much the same way.

Her parents didnt hesitate. They hopped in the car with Jordan and drove about an hour away to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where they begged with doctors and medical staff to treat their concerns with greater alarm.

When Jordyns face started swelling, as her parents suspected it would, her mother showed a photograph from the last time this had happened to the medical professionals at the Center. Finally, they took the family seriously.

Unfortunately, this time, the swelling was even worse. Jordyns face, particularly her eyes, began to swell so severely that they began popping out of her head. Doctors tried to limit the pressure caused by the swelling by removing Jordyns eyelids. When this was not enough, they had to sever her eyes themselves, a sensation that Jordyn was very much aware of at the time.

It was too late, however. The pressure and the surgery that doctors had been required to perform on her eyes had left Jordyn blind& permanently, and nobody knew why.

**Jordyns Medical History**

Jordyn had always struggled with strange, nigh inexplicable medical ailments. When Jordyn had been a toddler, she developed vomiting and bloody diarrhea so severe that she had to be hospitalized for it.

Doctors ultimately determined that these symptoms were the result of colitis, a condition that involved swelling of the colon lining, causing uncomfortable sores to form within the colon. It was a serious inconvenience but one that Jordyn had learned to live with.

Other medical conditions sprung up from time to time throughout Jordyns childhood but none but the colitis seemed particularly severe. Nonetheless, Jordyn remained an optimistic child, willing to see the best in the world and make the best of her life rather than bemoan the medical circumstances that seemed to plague her.

However, in 2017, Jordyns family went on a planned cruise. Jordyn begged her parents not to make her go on this cruise, telling them that she sensed that something bad was going to happen, though she couldnt say what. Her mother assuaged her fears, and the family departed on their vacation. The cruise took them to the Bahamas among other Caribbean locations and seemed to go off without a hitch.

After the cruise, Jordyn was scheduled to stay with her aunt in North Carolina, while the rest of her family returned to Missouri. For the first few days, nothing seemed to be the matter. Then, Jordyns colitis began to flare up, with the bloody stools and stomach cramps that typically came with it.

Jordyns aunt reasonably believed that these symptoms would fade over time, but they didnt. In fact, they got worse, and Jordyn began experiencing symptoms that neither she nor her family had ever seen before.

Her face began to swell severely, and dark bruises appeared across it. Blood clots formed within her nostrils, and her aunt panicked, driving her to a hospital within North Carolinas cutting-edge Research Triangle.

Doctors there were puzzled. They gave her medications to address her colitis and to reduce the swelling, and, over time, Jordyns condition faded. Doctors assured the family that it must be a one in a million situation and that they suspected that Jordyn was simply suffering from some sort of allergic reaction.

Then, life went on as normal, for about a year ago, at least until Jordyn started experiencing the symptoms that had marked the onset of this terrifying condition. She and her family rushed to the hospital, horrified that this was all happening again. They were right.

**The Search for Answers**

Jordyn and her parents were determined to discover what had caused her to suddenly lose her eyesight. They visited all kinds of specialists, and none of them could explain what had happened to Jordyn.

Doctors suggested that the same condition that caused Jordyns gastrointestinal issues had also caused this horrible facial swelling, but they couldnt pin down what exactly it was. They have proposed a wide variety of potential ailments that could lead to this, but extensive testing has proved definitively that Jordyn does not have these conditions.

Jordyn and her family publicized her case widely, appearing on talk shows such as Dr. Oz and having her story covered by the Today show. Nonetheless, no answers emerged.

They even raised money through a GoFundMe to take a trip to the Mayo Clinic, renowned for its ability to solve the toughest medical mysteries and perform the most complicated surgeries. Even they were stumped by Jordyns condition.

Thus, several years later, Jordyn and her family still dont know what caused this terrifying condition& or if it might come back in the future.

Obviously, they hope this wont be the case. Jordyn herself has stated, I just hope it never happens again. I don't really know what else I can lose. But without knowing exactly what caused these horrible circumstances, theres simply no way to know whether it will happen again.

**Conclusion**

Though Jordyns medical mystery is certainly tragic, it has not stopped her from living her best life. Many people would be devastated by this awful occurrence and would understandably let it derail their life but not Jordyn. Her unbridled optimism and sense of humor shines through despite this.

Jordyn was involved in both photography and archery before her sudden loss of eyesight. On the subject of archery at least, Jordyn jests, I can still do it. It is just different. With archery I didnt know how to aim before. Now, they cant get angry at me if I miss. Though shes undoubtedly been devastated by these circumstances, she has refused to let it stop her from cracking jokes and enjoying life.

Jordyn has asserted that, Im not going to let this stop me. By all accounts, she hasnt. A Facebook group that was set up to promote fundraising efforts for Jordyns medical bills didnt post any updates for almost two years.

Then, an update came from Jordyns family, in which she is referred to as Jay, the nickname she seems to like most. The update says that Jordyn successfully graduated high school and has completed her first semester at the University of Central Missouri, where she pledged a sorority.

This was back in January of 2022 and besides a YouTube video documenting Jordyns condition, there have been no updates since. This is both good and bad news. Of course, it means that there have been no new developments in solving the medical mystery that has plagued Jordyn and her family, but it also means that things are likely still going well for her.

Jordyn was faced with an unimaginable, inexplicable situation that could have easily broken her. Instead, she has persevered, and its my hope that she continues to receive a great education and has a great college experience at the University of Central Missouri. She certainly seems like the kind of person with the drive to do some really amazing things; I certainly hope that she gets that opportunity.

He was famous for his mystery stories and iconic detective/sidekick duo, though one who wished that he would actually be known for his historical fiction. He was a lapsed ophthalmologist, a man of science whose books stood practically at the forefront of the newly developing field of forensics and always had rational-sounding explanations for the seemingly impossible. He was a real-life solver of cases who successfully led campaigns to exonerate two marginalized men of crimes they did not commit.

And yet he was also an ardent spiritualist, who by the time of his death was likely spiritualism's most famous and public proponent, making clear his belief in mediums, fairies, spirits, and the ability to communicate with the deceased. He was taken in by a clear hoax perpetrated by two young girls and insisted that Harry Houdini must have had spiritual powers, despite Houdini's own insistence that he did not, ruining his friendship with Houdini in the process.

This [very good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/10zsjtb/literature_agatha_christies_dramatic/) by u/EquivalentInflation, while really about the disappearance of Agatha Christie, mentioned Conan Doyle's spiritualism relatively in passing, and it was a factoid that many commenters seemed fascinated by- and definitely something worth going into more detail about. Because to Conan Doyle, it wasn't a mere factoid at all- he was known to have said that he would sacrifice his literary reputation (which was substantial) for the sake of promoting spiritualism.

&amp;#x200B;

**Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.**

Arthur Conan Doyle was a Scottish ophthalmologist without enough patients to keep him occupied (or financially solvent) when he wrote his first Sherlock Holmes story in a fit of boredom bordering on despair in the mid-1880s. After A Study in Scarlet was rejected by multiple publishers, it was printed in Beeton's Annual in 1887. The next Holmes story, The Sign of Four, was published by Lippincott's in 1890. Both were published as serials, but Conan Doyle soon realized that the wave of the future would be connected but self contained short stories rather than serials, which could be read in any order. His first set of short stories about Sherlock Holmes was therefore published soon after in the Strand magazine, and they set the world on fire far beyond what Conan Doyle had ever dreamed.

Though he was far from the first fictional private detective (he was preceded by Poe's Dupin and Gaboriau's Lecoq, both of whom the character of Holmes skewers in A Study in Scarlet), Sherlock Holmes represented something different and interesting in the genre. The crimes which he solves (a surprisingly small number of which deal with murder, particularly early on) are placed before him like puzzles, which he has to explain in a rational way. Watson- whose function in the narrative was new in crime fiction, and soon to be copied endlessly- is there throughout to not just describe the scene but to describe Holmes, so that readers have an inimitable and vivid quirky detective to latch on to.

Another Conan Doyle innovation was to make sure that the process of solving the crime was laid out so that the reader could see how it was done. Obviously here, Watson plays a key role- through him, the readers can see all the clues that Holmes does, but because Watson is not quite as intelligent as Holmes, we don't see how they all come together to form the solution until Holmes chooses to reveal the truth. In addition to the logic that Holmes emphasizes as the most important thing, Watson tells us that Holmes also has a wide array of (and absence of) skills and knowledge- to quote his assessment in A Study in Scarlet,

Holmes, therefore, has a sizable base of knowledge- largely scientific and historical- to base his crime-solving on, and is not just interested in logical deduction but in systematic forensics (like fingerprinting and document analysis) in a way that even the police forces of his time were only starting to embark on. Like his mentor and model for Sherlock Holmes, Dr Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle emphasized the need to rely on observation to solve crimes, and thus to explain things which seem inexplicable and read the evidence of your own eyes (and other senses as well). There is no supernatural activity in Sherlock Holmes- except for the purpose of being explained and debunked as cold solid rational fact.

Conan Doyle himself was no intellectual slouch- in addition to his fiction writing career (in addition to mysteries he wrote many highly regarded novels and short stories on themes ranging from horror to historical fiction), he took the time to get the convictions of two wrongly imprisoned men, George Edalji and Oscar Slater, overturned by the British courts. He was clearly able, to whatever degree, to apply the principles of rationality and observation in his own personal life.

And that's what makes it so surprising when one realizes that while he was starting to create the first scientific detective, Conan Doyle was also taking his first steps into the world of spiritualism.

It's something of a truism to people who know something about Conan Doyle and spiritualism that he got into it after the death of his son Kingsley during WWI. This, however, is not true. Conan Doyle is known to have expressed an interest in spiritualism and attending seances at least as far back as 1887, the year that his first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, was published.

This was, for the record, not at all unusual. Spiritualism had become very popular in the 1840s (with the seances of the Fox sisters being particularly influential), and figures like Queen Victoria and Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln are known to have participated in seances in the hopes of communicating with deceased loved ones. That said, as popular as spiritualism was before WWI, during and after the war it skyrocketed in popularity. Millions of people all around the world now had relatives whom they had suddenly and violently lost- whether in the war itself or in the ensuing flu pandemic- and the idea that someone could bring messages from those departed was an appealing one.

Conan Doyle's personal full conversion to spiritualism after years of interest (including joining psychic research societies, which did investigations to verify supernatural phenomena) seems to have come in 1916, when a family friend and medium, Lily Loder Symonds, apparently fully convinced him of its validity through a seance. In 1917, Conan Doyle was already passionate about spiritualism, and in 1918, following Kingsley's death, Conan Doyle and his second wife, Jean, participated in a seance to communicate with him. This only left him even more enthusiastic and evangelical.

When I say evangelical, I mean it. Conan Doyle participated in debates, wrote books, and went on lecture tours throughout Europe, North America, and Australia and New Zealand. He would go to seances and make his judgments as to whether they were genuine or fraudulent- and, in a twist that foreshadowed his relationship with Houdini, in some cases he might decide that real psychic power was demonstrated at a seance which the medium themselves would admit was fraudulent!

He also, very famously, was taken in by a hoax by two girls, Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths, who claimed to take five photographs showing themselves with fairies. After the photos had been promoted by various spiritualist societies, they had come to Conan Doyle's attention when he used them to illustrate an article about fairies that he had been commissioned to write for the Strand magazine- the same magazine which published the Holmes stories. He fervently believed that they were real, as he believed that two working class Yorkshire girls couldn't have been sophisticated enough to create them. The Cottingley fairies, as they came to be known, were a huge story in 1920-21 which was fervently promoted by Conan Doyle, mostly to journalistic scorn at his gullibility. In the 1980s, the two girls, now grown women, admitted that they had faked the photos- which, with all due respect to Conan Doyle, [seems obvious in hindsight](https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/The-Fairies-of-Cottingley/).

Just a quick note here- as we all sit here judging Conan Doyle for his credulity, let's put him back in context. (And then we'll go back to judging him, don't worry.)

As noted above, spiritualism was *very* popular at this time. Conan Doyle was far from the only high-profile person to believe in it- one of the most famous scientific men in England, Sir Oliver Lodge, one of the inventors of the technology behind the radio, was a fellow spiritualism enthusiast. He, like Conan Doyle, had lost a son during WWI and saw spiritualism and seances as a way to get him back. (Conan Doyle, incidentally, hadn't just lost his son- his beloved brother Innes\*, two of his brothers in law and two of his nephews had died during this period. One of these brothers in law was EW Hornung, the creator of the Raffles character/stories.)

^(\*EDITED: Thank you to) u/PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS ^(for pointing out that this was missing!)

At this time in history, science and technology were moving rapidly and new frontiers were being discovered constantly. This was, after all, the era of Einstein, in which a whole new kind of physics was essentially being opened up that demonstrated how little we understood the universe- and even the old one was producing inventions as miraculous-seeming as the telephone and the radio. Lodge's own spiritualist research often took scientific principles that he was using for his physics research and applied them to spiritualism with experiments intending to prove whether, for example, telekinesis was possible and if so under what circumstances. To many, spiritualism was only another way in which humanity was continuing to discover how their world worked.

This was expressed by all of the experimentation and investigative research that many spiritualists, Conan Doyle leading among them, would do in order to verify or debunk supernatural phenomena. To Conan Doyle, his belief in spiritualism could very easily fit in with his belief in evidence- because he looked for evidence. Was he blinkered by preconceived notions about what could be possible? Sure. But he didn't believe *everything,* and as we'll see below he even pulled tricks that fooled more twisty thinkers. He was fully aware that things were being faked and could be faked. He just believed that he had managed to understand what was and wasn't faked.

And, as mentioned, this was *really* popular. It wasn't at all unusual, as alluded to above, for newspapers to uncritically print articles about seances, supernatural phenomena, etc. While it wasn't the *dominant* way of looking at the world, and while over the course of the 1920s the general outlook turned more toward skepticism (so that by the time that Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, for example, were writing their mystery fiction, a seance was more likely to have been used cynically in a plot as a way to manipulate a gullible character), it was still absolutely a force that did not by any means dismiss Conan Doyle as a total crackpot in the eyes of his contemporaries. (Just as something of a crackpot.)

But at the end of the day, yes, Conan Doyle was credulous- and also swept up in a movement much bigger than he was. And it wasn't just him- his second wife, the former Jean Leckie, was a medium herself. So when he met someone who could do some of the most amazing feats he had ever seen, Conan Doyle was perfectly ready to believe that they had been accomplished through supernatural means. To Harry Houdini, who would come to know him quite well, if briefly, it seemed that ""it wasn't as though he was deceived, but merely a case of a religious mania.""

&amp;#x200B;

**The more outré and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined.**

Harry Houdini had come at this whole thing from basically the opposite way.

Houdini, previously Ehrich Weiss, had actually started off doing some seances in his early career alongside his wife Bess- it's unclear to me the extent to which he believed that the phenomena that he experienced on these seances could have actually been genuine (though it is clear that he was very well versed in how to fake them). But over time, as he became more and more familiar with the ways in which he and other performers were able to use physical, technical, and psychological trickery to fool people into believing that the supernatural (or, in his case, the physically impossible) had taken place, as much as he *wanted* to believe that spiritualism could possibly be a real force, he was coming to the conclusion that it was unlikely, and that, more importantly, many people were being taken advantage of by fraudsters. And as someone with the kinds of skills to be able to unmask those fraudsters, Houdini took it upon himself to serve as a kind of proto-James Randi, going to seances and other spiritualist entertainments and debunking them by explaining how the trickery took place.

However, Houdini was still interested in the occult, and so when he went to the UK in 1920 on a tour, he was interested in meeting with this man of science and reason who was such a fervent believer in spiritualism. Maybe Conan Doyle really *had* managed to unearth authentic spiritualism, sifting with his logical mind through all of the trickery? Eager to meet him, by way of introduction Houdini sent him a copy of his recent book The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin, in which Houdini had explained the ways in which the great magician Robert-Houdin (from whom Houdini had borrowed his name) had managed to fool his audiences.

Conan Doyle was, in turn, eager to meet Houdini, for whom he had a great admiration that probably well exceeded what Houdini was expecting (as would soon become clear), and they soon became friendly. Conan Doyle gave him a tour of spiritualism in the United Kingdom, telling him that he'd managed to sort out the honest and truly spiritual ones from the fakes. Houdini in turn followed Conan Doyle's recommendations, visiting over 100 seances- and concluding that *all* of them, even the ones which had been recommended by Conan Doyle as genuine, were in fact fraudulent.

This gave him pause, but didn't stop him from continuing a friendly correspondence with Conan Doyle over the next two years, and from taking time off from his magic career to research spiritualism and spiritualists. Houdini even paid tribute to him in one of his movies, in which he played a character who was shown to be reading one of Conan Doyle's works on spiritualism, A New Revelation (a book which Houdini had himself read and enjoyed).

The friendship was doomed to end in famously bad temper, never to recover, in 1922- but maybe a potent hint that all would soon be lost could already be seen from the start of their acquaintanceship, doomed before it began. It was a theme that Conan Doyle would include in his letters to Houdini, which Houdini would then ignore or contradict- which could not dissuade him.

According to Conan Doyle, Houdini was using supernatural powers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence. The question is what can you make people believe you have done.**

The relationship would all come crashing down in one massively disastrous visit by Conan Doyle to New York in 1922, though that didn't become evident til after it was over.

Conan Doyle was in the US for a lecture tour on spiritualism, and one evening, Houdini hosted a dinner party at the Society of American Magicians in his honor. It seems to have been a largely successful evening- and in fact it made the front page of the New York Times. Conan Doyle, this time, would be the trickster rather than the gullible mark.

Conan Doyle had, as we've noted, previously expressed a fascination with photographs that would seem to represent supernatural things. After watching a show made up of such renowned magicians as Max Malini and Horace Goldin (as well as, of course, Houdini himself), he set up a projector at the dinner and showed a film to the magicians' society- a scene of dinosaurs rampaging through the wilderness. According to later reports, the magicians were stunned. Dinosaurs, of course, could not exist; what then could Conan Doyle have done?

What he had done, of course, was present stop motion animation. It was of a kind and quality as yet unseen in American cinema, which explains why his display of the clip soon prompted a lawsuit by the man who claimed to have invented the brand-new process, which he said had been stolen from him by an unscrupulous former assistant for use in Conan Doyle's new movie, The Lost World, based on one of his novels. But it was something that the magicians had never before seen and thus could not explain.

Conan Doyle had, according to a letter he wrote to Houdini and had published in the newspaper a few days later, claimed that it was ""not occult and only psychic... preternatural in the sense that it was not nature as we know it."" He said this to justify any misrepresentations he may have made in front of the crowd, but to be honest I think the fact that he could claim this with a straight face says a lot about how he saw the supernatural as a rational man.

So Conan Doyle had flipped the script- he'd managed to be the one to fool the skeptic and the skeptic's friends, all of whom were well versed in trickery. One would think that things would be great with Houdini afterward, and in fact they were.

But things were still complicated, and would only get more complicated. Houdini was bristling at Conan Doyle's repeated mentions of detecting psychic powers in him as expressed through his tricks- when, of course, Houdini knew EXACTLY how he'd pulled the tricks off and worked hard at them, and knew full well that no psychic power was in play there. This theme recurred in Conan Doyle's letters to Houdini, as he believed that when he saw Houdini perform tricks like the milk can disappearance, he could sense a disappearing psychic energy, akin to one he experienced at seances. Conan Doyle even said to Houdini, ""My dear chap, why go around the world seeking a demonstration of the occult when you are giving one all the time?""

And, in a cab on the way from Houdini's home to Conan Doyle's hotel, Houdini performed a trick- he made his thumb disappear. If this sounds like the kind of trick you learned how to do when you were a kid, that's because that's exactly what it was- and for Houdini, probably the simplest and most transparent trick in his repertoire. And yet, Conan Doyle seems to have been honestly amazed by it, and to have considered the possibility- or even probability- that it had been accomplished through spiritual powers! Houdini was starting to be very disconcerted.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Well?"" said he.""Do you not find it interesting?""""To a collector of fairy-tales.**

Throughout this visit, Houdini continued to try to debunk phony spiritualists (many of whom Conan Doyle believed to be completely genuine) and to demonstrate to Conan Doyle that it was, in fact, possible to do the seeming impossible without the use of psychic power. It was frustrating to have to explain this to the man who created a detective whose entire gimmick is to explain the impossible rationally, and yet that came to be his role again and again. He debunked seances, he explained to Conan Doyle (using step by step photo illustrations) how a popular stunt involving ""ghosts"" leaving paraffin casts of their hands in water was done, and he even performed tricks- more impressive than the disappearing thumb.

When he'd do these tricks, he swore up and down that they had been done solely through trickery and completely rational means. And yet, still, Conan Doyle found this impossible to believe. When Houdini demonstrated a trick in which Conan Doyle hung a chalkboard in the middle of a room, wrote on a piece of paper outside the room, and then upon re-entering saw a ball of ink-covered cork writing those same words on the chalkboard, Houdini continued to avow that this was all done through sleight of hand (and indeed it had been- a trick which he had bought from a retired vaudeville magician) and Conan Doyle refused to believe him. It was a pattern which Houdini had grown used to.

After all, he liked Conan Doyle personally. He and his wife got along with Sir Arthur (as Houdini invariably referred to him) and his wife, and Houdini enjoyed playing with Conan Doyle's young children. So when the Conan Doyles invited the Houdinis to Atlantic City, NJ, for a beachside vacation, it at first seemed like a wonderful idea. Houdini swam with the Conan Doyle kids and showed them his trick for staying underwater (inhaling and exhaling 6-8 times before going under), and then they went back to their discussion of spiritualism.

On a subsequent day of the trip, Conan Doyle asked Houdini if he would like to sit for an automatic writing session with his wife, Jean, who claimed to have mediumistic powers. He agreed, and from the description that he wrote the same day (which he changed later), he seems to have gone into it with a reasonably open mind. It soon transpired that, according to Jean, Houdini's mother was in the room with them and wanted to communicate with her son.

Houdini had been very close with his mother, Cecilia Weiss, and so having her appear to him would- if real- be a massive deal; indeed, Jean had already told Houdini that his mother had been in the room with them the day before, after doing table rapping. Houdini did, however, remember his wife Bess mentioning to him that Jean had been peppering her with questions about his mother the day before.

The whole thing didn't get off to a great start when, after Jean asked the spirit if she was religious and apparently got an answer in the affirmative, she indicated this by writing a cross on the paper- after all, Houdini's mother was Jewish. Then she produced a long paragraph of writing said to be by Houdini's mother, about how it was wonderful to be speaking with him and she was in a better place and preparing to have him be with her there. Upon concentrating on the question ""can my mother read my mind,"" Houdini was somewhat, but not totally, shocked to see a new paragraph be written answering this question in the affirmative, as Conan Doyle had been the one to suggest the question to him. According to this writing allegedly by his mother, Houdini had been brought together with Conan Doyle through her own spiritual agency.

After the seance, Houdini decided to try some automatic writing of his own- and after getting some pointers from the Conan Doyles, he sat down, opened his mind, and wrote the word ""Powell."" This absolutely freaked Conan Doyle out- he'd had a friend named Powell who had died the previous week, and was convinced that this was some kind of a spiritual communication from the beyond. Houdini, though, after a certain amount of thought, came to the conclusion that the name Powell had come to mind because he and Bess had recently been discussing the situation of a magician named Powell whose wife was too ill to assist him on stage and had therefore hired a young girl to assist- they had been arguing over whether this was suitable.

And, of course, Conan Doyle refused to believe him.

&amp;#x200B;

**""Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons, with the greatest for the last.**

Conan Doyle and Houdini parted on good terms soon after- for the last time.

They corresponded in the usual vein of skeptic debunker vs ardent spiritualist, with Conan Doyle even writing to Houdini with additional information that had come through from his mother in the beyond. Houdini took it all in good humor until after Conan Doyle's return to London, when he crossed a line:

He declared, publicly, that Houdini had been converted to spiritualism through the seance with his mother.

Houdini could not allow this to stand. He wrote, also publicly, that not only had he not been converted to spiritualism, he was more skeptical than ever. Not only had there been a cross on the automatic writing paper, but it had been written in perfect and idiomatic English of a kind that Houdini's mother, an immigrant, had never spoken- and the alleged spirit of Houdini's mother had never mentioned that the previous day had been her birthday.

The impact of the public eye on their disagreements was grievous. Previously, they'd each been writing things which were contentious, but for each other's eyes only- and therefore the inconvenient could be ignored for the sake of their friendship. But now, journalists were asking Houdini whether he believed that the Conan Doyles were frauds- and he didn't know how to answer them. The Conan Doyles, in turn, expressed their anger and frustration that Houdini seemed to be badmouthing them publicly.

In 1924, it was Houdini whose action put the final nail in the coffin of their relationship- he started a lecture series that Conan Doyle saw as a direct counteraction of his own, demonstrating the ways in which fraudulent mediums (including some of the very ones in whom Conan Doyle placed his faith) were fooling the public. Conan Doyle took it as a personal affront. Effectively, the relationship was over, though it had been on its last legs for some time.

Houdini took the opportunity of no longer needing to account for Conan Doyle's feelings to become even more open about his skepticism- which ended up boosting his career as it meant a slight rebrand. He even testified before Congress in favor of a bill that would have outlawed fraudulent fortune-tellers. He also felt no hesitation about directly calling out Conan Doyle's gullibility in the Cottingley Fairies case and announced from stage at a performance that he'd be suing Conan Doyle for libel. After Houdini had debunked a famous medium, Margery, Conan Doyle had criticized his methods and Houdini understood him to be accusing him of accepting bribes.

Conan Doyle, in turn, remained as resolute not just about spiritualism, but about his conviction that Houdini himself had psychic powers. As he continued to publicly feud with Houdini, particularly in an era in which spiritualism was slowly waning and Houdini's debunking was very popular, Conan Doyle couldn't escape a certain amount of public backlash, which left him entirely unmoved.

This feud would, in the end, not last much longer, as Houdini died in 1926 as the result of a ruptured appendix.  But though Conan Doyle and Bess Houdini seem to have reconciled afterward, it still wasn't quite over.

I first learned that Conan Doyle and Houdini feuded because of my interest in Jewish history.

I used to run the Tuesday Trivia weekly thread on r/AskHistorians (now it's done by a much more capable and punctual bot), and one day I read something that led me to make the next Tuesday's theme [magic](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h9upqt/tuesday_trivia_are_you_a_more_interesting_history/). I wanted to talk about something I had read in the fascinating autobiography of Rabbi Bernard Drachman. You can see the full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/h9upqt/comment/fv103pv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), but suffice it to say that he was a leading traditionalist rabbi in New York at the turn of the 20th century who claimed, among other things, to have been Houdini's rabbi. I discuss that particular claim and its veracity in the above link, but there's one particular thing he mentions that I'll quote in full because I find it to be fascinating:

&gt;It was my sad privilege to officiate at the funeral. His passing became the occasion for the widespread discussion of his personality and the extraordinary powers which he unquestionably possessed.... What these powers were I, of course, know as little as anyone else, but they certainly were far above the vulgar sleight-of-hand and tricks of ordinary so-called magicians. The Spiritualists claimed Houdini as one of their own and asserted that his escape from apparently unsuperable means of confinement was due to his ability to dematerialize his body and thus pass through all physical restraints. Houdini himself denied that he was a Spiritualist medium- he was, indeed, an outspoken opponent of spiritualism- and stated that his performances were strictly in accordance with natural law.  
&gt;  
&gt;This statement, of course, left the matter as much of a mystery as before. The Spiritualists refused to accept Houdini's denial that he was a medium. They insisted that he was. They even tried to drag me into the controversy as upholding their contention. In my funeral address I had used the words, ""Houdini possessed a wondrous power that he never understood and which he never revealed to anyone in life."" These words are meant to be taken in their narrowest and most literal significance. All I meant was that Houdini possessed an extraordinary and mysterious power- and by that statement I am still willing to stand- the precise nature and quality of which was not clear even to him and that he had never taken anyone into his confidence nor revealed what his concept of his extraordinary gift was.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the Spiritualists seized upon these words to draw from them the utterly unjustified inference that I considered Houdini a Spiritualist medium and that his powers were derived from a super-mundane, non-material source. Arthur Conan Doyle, the well-known author and Spiritualist leader, interprets them to this effect in his book, *The Edge of the Unknown.* Of course, I meant nothing of the kind. My statement was merely a recognition of his undeniably extraordinary power, concerning the nature of which I admit that I am just as ignorant as everybody else, including A. C. Doyle, neither more nor less.

Conan Doyle had, indeed, quoted Drachman in his book, saying that

&gt;At that burial some curious and suggestive words were used by the presiding rabbi, Barnard Drachman. He said: ""Houdini possessed a wondrous power that he never Understood, and which he never revealed to anyone in life."" Such an expression coming at so solemn a moment from one who may have been in a special position to know must show that my speculations are not extravagant or fantastic when I deal with the real source of those powers. The rabbi's speech is to be taken with Houdini's own remark, when he said to my wife: ""There are some of my feats which my own wife does not know the secret of.""

So, bottom line is- in an action entirely characteristic of Conan Doyle, who believed that death was no barrier, he saw no reason not to continue this particular feud after his sparring partner had passed. And in fact, he showed no signs of having changed his mind right up until  his own death in 1930.

And as for Houdini? Despite, or perhaps because of, his skepticism, he'd arranged before his death that every year on its anniversary his wife Bess would hold a seance, and they prearranged a signal to indicate that any alleged supernatural visitor was indeed him. Bess held a yearly seance every year on the anniversary for ten years, at which point she gave it up as a bad job.

&amp;#x200B;

**The most important thing in the world**

So what was the bottom line?

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle still has the reputation that he deservedly holds for his literature. He was truly a groundbreaking writer of detective fiction and very talented in the other genres in which he chose to write, and he is also rightly remembered for his commitment to justice and his efforts in obtaining the freedom of unjustly imprisoned men.

And yet- his whole-souled embrace of spiritualism absolutely came to affect his legacy. While the average reader of a Sherlock Holmes story may never know about it (he left no trace of spiritualism in his mystery fiction), no discussion of him as a writer of these books can really leave it out. There always seems to be a need to try to reconcile- how can such an erudite, intelligent, and logical man have been so credulous?

This isn't only a retroactive discussion- in his time, the very same dichotomy was a massive topic of discussion. Even in a time in which spiritualism was commonplace, it was still mocked, and this was only more so for Conan Doyle given his previous reputation. And while it didn't necessarily affect Sherlock Holmes's popularity, it's unquestionable that spiritualism cast a shadow over the popular conception of Conan Doyle himself.

In the end, when Conan Doyle died, the headline of his New York Times obituary read ""CONAN DOYLE DEAD FROM HEART ATTACK; **Spiritist** \[emphasis mine\], Novelist and Creator of Famous Fiction Detective Ill Two Months--Was 71."" The next headline read  ""FAMILY AWAITS 'MESSAGE' Son Is Confident Father Will Confirm Spirit Existence, in Which He Believed. Told of Spirit Talks. Family Awaits a Message."" Only in the third subject heading is Conan Doyle's literary career discussed.

That said- it seems like Conan Doyle himself didn't much mind. He was known to have said that he would, to quote his estate's official [website](https://arthurconandoyle.co.uk/spiritualist), ""gladly sacrifice whatever literary reputation he enjoyed if it would bring about a greater acceptance of his psychic message.""

In that case, he got away relatively lightly in the long term.","HobbyDrama",106,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11kd8lj/literature_magic_once_you_have_eliminated_the/"

Lawmakers across the country have filed hundreds of pieces of anti-transgender legislation for the 2023 session, setting out to further marginalize a community of people who already faced a year of unprecedented violence and threats to their existence.

While the media often portrays the anti-LGBTQ+ mission of Americas rightwing elements as part of a culture war, some members of the community, allies, and activists argue that it is best described as a (state) government-sponsored genocidefar from a nebulous battle of ideas and values. Depending on what state one lives in, various expressions of LGBTQ+ identity are actively being legislated out of existence and criminalized. Transgender individuals, in particular, are being stripped of rights at an alarming rate by lawmakers beholden to rightwing propaganda campaigns. Working in concerteither intentionally or unintentionallywith far-right extremists, this combination amounts to a coordinated attempt to eradicate the transgender community from wide swaths of the nation.

#Gender affirming care

*Definition: Gender-affirming care is a model of care which includes a spectrum of social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individuals gender identity.*

One of the strongest examples of how anti-transgender laws can be considered a form of genocide are bills that ban gender affirming care. Pay special attention to part (b) in the following definition:

The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [defines](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) genocide as any acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; **(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group**; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Legislators in 37 states have filed bills that prohibit gender affirming care in various forms and for various age groups. If successful, their states will join the [four](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/youth-access-to-gender-affirming-care-the-federal-and-state-policy-landscape/) that previously banned gender affirming care for minors.

These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 

* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.

* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.

Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.

Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 

&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.

* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.

* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.

#Child Abuse

Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.

In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 

&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.

Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 

* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 

* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.

* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.

* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide

Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 

Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.

The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.

##Classification

Definition: Division of us and them

Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi

Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.

These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 

Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.

##Dehumanization

Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group

Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin

During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 

The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 

Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.

After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 

&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.

&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 

###Drag performances

Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 

Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.

* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.

* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.

* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/"

2023-02-23,1677128529,"My college girlfriend went missing in 2005. She just showed up at my door, and she hasnt aged.","Melissa? I gasped.

Abject horror must have been painted on my nonplussed face. The girl was no *figurative* ghost from my past  I could see her tangible form before me, as plainly as the doorstep on which she stood.

I was eighteen years old when she went missing. We were university freshers, and wed been dating since college  or the twelfth grade in the States. Boyfriends are often suspects in cases of missing women, so I was unphased by the incessant police questioning. However, much to many peoples disbelief, Melissas disappearance was a mystery to me.

When I first entered her dorm room, after twenty-four hours without contact, everything was untouched. No sign of forced entry. On Melissas desk, there was a sturdy stack of biology books, a Nokia brick-phone  which was ordinarily welded to her hand  and, perhaps most ominously, a lifeless plate of day-old lasagna.

Eighteen years later, at the age of thirty-six, that vivid, vibrant memory had not waned in my mind. The most horrifying thing about Melissas sudden reappearance  three hours ago  was that she hadnt aged. Like a snapshot of the past, she was still wearing the purple plaid cardigan and denim jeans from the last day on which Id seen her.

Hi, Andy, Melissa said.

The eighteen-year-old girl on my porch did not allow me more than a few seconds to gather my thoughts. That was probably for the best, as I think my mind mightve shattered if Id tried to piece together the impossibility before me.

Youre probably wondering where Ive been for so many years, She sheepishly said.

Im wondering a lot of things right now, I breathlessly spluttered.

Let me show you, She eerily whispered.

Before I had a chance to refuse, my ageless ex-girlfriend seized my hand, and the world swirled into a kaleidoscope of colours. Bright, beautiful hues of red, yellow, blue, and green encompassed me. They quickly morphed into grim, ghastly shades of black. I shrieked in terror at the dreadful vision that followed.

In the darkness, I caught frightful flashes of the day on which Melissa disappeared. A faceless silhouette apprehended her in a forest, and Melissa kept crying that she had no idea how shed ended up there. The shadowy presence ignored her pleas for help, instead dragging her to its darkened cave and slowly stretching her body over itself like a snugly winter coat. Melissa screamed, inexplicably still alive, as the silhouette clothed itself in her body. When the screaming ceased, the thing that pretended to be my girlfriend calmly strolled out of the cave.

Our real surroundings returned, and I found myself facing the abomination on my porch. Melissas face started to melt, as if she were a wax candle  the wick being her lopsided head. Her grin was sickening. It wasnt the warm, endearing smile of the girl I used to know. It was the crooked, ill-meaning expression of something feigning humanity.

I love you so much, Andy, Melissa said. Its been so painful without you. I didnt realise that was what my body needed. Thats the missing ingredient. I cant sustain myself without you.

It stretched a gauntly hand towards me, stepping towards my front door as I took a step backwards. I couldnt utter a word. I could scarcely move, but I eventually summoned the courage to hightail it through my house and out of the back door.

I took the first bus I hailed, and Ive been on the road for three hours. I dont know where Im going, and I dont care. I decided to post what happened on here in the hope that somebody could tell me what the *fuck* just knocked on my door.

It definitely wasnt Melissa, and I dont think itll stop until it finds me again.

For my HobbyDrama premiere I thought I'd reminisce on a piece of Skyrim Modding history that took place on this exact day 4 years ago. Today, I tell the tale of the Skyrim Together controversy - an event which left a lingering impression on the modding community and whose shockwaves sends small ripples even years later.

As with any fandom, the *Skyrim* community (especially the modding scene) is not without its drama and new drama tends to pop up on a regular basis, but few ever reached the heights of the events that transcribed during the **Skyrim Together Controversy**.

&gt;***Note***: fun fact - the timing of this post is mostly a coincidence. I started writing this a week before and discovered the date it all happened *while* researching, obviously rushing to finish on time.

So what exactly was this event and how did it affect the community of passionate Skyrim fans? To understand that, let's first establish some context...

# Context and Background

***The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*** is an open-world action RPG developed by ***Bethesda Studios*** and released on November 11, 2011. The game made quite the impression at the time, gaining near-universal praise and eventually going on to become a household video game name (of course spawning [countless memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim) along the way) and birthing an extremely vibrant modding community that is still incredibly active to this day.

&gt;***Note***: a **modder** is a hobbyist who creates personalised modifications (""mods"") to a game.

One may argue that Bethesda Studios owes much of the popularity and longevity of their games to the modding community. And indeed they are most definitely aware of this as the gaming studio has had a long history of being extremely welcoming to **modders,** granting players extensive mod support throughout the years going back to even *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* (whose modding scene is similarly active today even 20 years after release).

The Skyrim modding community in particular is well-known for being abnormally creative in their endeavours. You can replace dragons with [Thomas The Tank Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNaTZV8qS1I). You can make [chickens explode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKl7ELLfiBI). This community is to gaming what Rule 34 is to pornography. If someone has thought of it, another person has made a mod for it. Hell, some mods have broken the confines of their modding status and become *full-fledged games of their own*, such as [The Forgotten City](https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/The_Forgotten_City/) and [Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/) \- two video games that started off as Skyrim mods.

But anyway, I digress a little. My point is: the modding community is incredibly large and is capable of anything. This was especially amplified with the advent of a modding breakthrough known as **SKSE** (Skyrim Script Extender) - a tool created by **The SKSE Team** that expands the scripting capacities of the game and enables a greater arsenal of modding possibilities.

It is very worth noting that the SKSE Team is absolutely revered in modding circles, I simply cannot overstate how respected SKSE is in the community. They paved the way for hundreds of thousands of incredible mods.

They also **play a central role** in the conflict to come.

So how does a 12-year old video game and its modding scene, The SKSE Team, and a mod called Skyrim Together fit together to create one of the most turbulent events in TESV modding history?

Let's break it down.

# Not-So-Humble Beginnings

**Skyrim Together** is a modding project that aims to breathe life to the fans biggest dreams: creating a **multiplayer experience** for the single-player video game. At the time, the project would have allowed for co-op play with support for up to 8 players, and within no time it had received a large and dedicated fanbase who supported the project religiously.

The project was not without its issues, however.

Essentially since the beginning it had been battling **code-theft allegations** from the aforementioned SKSE Team. The project was accused of using stolen code without crediting the SKSE Team, to the point where the **SKSE Team called them out in their License, explicitly banning Skyrim Online** (see Note) **from using their code.**

**The Skyrim Together** team naturally refuted these accusations. People tended to not believe them, especially as community members found it suspicious that the **developers were incredibly adamant they would never make the project open-source** (something that users would constantly suggest so the mod would have more transparency and so the project could move along faster). While there are legitimate reasons to keep a project closed-source,  the whole theft accusation did no favours in public perception with regard to the decision.

&gt;***Note#1:*** open-source means a program is basically ""public"", with the source code being available for anyone to read and edit.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Note#2***: the history of Skyrim Together is rather convoluted and worthy of its own drama post. Long story short: the original creator (Lagulous) and the second-in-command (Yamashi) merged their efforts after Yamashi's own multiplayer project Skyrim Online (the one facing code-theft allegations) was already ongoing. They renamed the project Skyrim Together. And then Yamashi allegedly forced Lagulous out of his own project. Take the story with a grain of salt but do read more drama [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/avzyq5/im_lagulous_the_original_creator_of_skyrim/) if you're interested.

And so work on the project went on like this for years, with it eventually being supported by **donations via Patreon,** and its **legion of fans growing steadily larger and larger**. There was of course some conflict and arguments that happened every now and then, but it wasn't until the release of the infamous **Closed Beta** version of the mod that the whole project blew up.

You see, up until that point this was just relatively tame modding drama. With the **Closed Beta**, however, the Skyrim Together team decided that in order to have access to the mod they would need to **charge 1USD minimum ""donations"" for access via Patreon**, officially stating that the funds would (in part) be used to host the servers you could play on. The entire thing was set up in tier levels so that

* 1 dollar gets you access to the mod with sub 10 tick rate servers.
* 20 dollars gets you access to the mod with 60 tick rate servers, and gives you early access to new patches/builds etc..

**At the time of the controversy the project was making** [**35000 USD a month**](https://web.archive.org/web/20190226225537/https://www.patreon.com/skyrimtogether)**.**

You read that right. The Skyrim Together team was raking in 35K per month in ""donations"" so players could access their project. Even disregarding the ethics of the decision, users were worried they had now also breached one of Bethesda Studio's ground rules on modding their games: mods cannot be made for financial exchange. The hordes of religious fans began to worry that the project would be shut down by Bethesda itself if this went on.

There was indeed even a not-so-insignificant number of people who worried that this project might lay out some harsh consequences on the Bethesda modding community overall: as mentioned already, Bethesda Studios has a long history of being extremely supportive of the modding scene. At the time of this event, the general worry was also that this could lead to major legal action by Bethesda itself and by default alter their stance towards the community.

# The Code That Broke The Camels Back

Now this is where the controversy really hit its peak.

See, after the Closed Beta came out, **the SKSE Team gained access to the mod and found irrefutable proof that there was** [**stolen SKSE code within the project**](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/av4f5f/skyrim_together_is_stealing_skse_source_code/)**.** Stolen Code, which the Skyrim Together team had for years denied was ever there. Not only had they been caught lying about that, they had now been caught accepting payment for it and not crediting the SKSE Team along the way.

Remember how I said the SKSE Team is one of the most respected projects in the community? Yeah, this was a BIG deal. It was at this point that [numerous reports and rumours regarding the project lead Yamashi also started circulating](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/aug73b/comment/eh7zv1p/?context=3), testifying to similar shady things he'd allegedly done throughout his modding career. You can read the links and make up your own mind.

The massive backlash sent shockwaves not only throughout the Skyrim modding community but the gaming community as a whole. YouTube [blew up](https://youtu.be/ktKfeWIYi-A). Reddit did what Reddit does best and devolved into anarchic discussions. Subreddits and YouTube channels dedicated to other Bethesda games were discussing the event. Even reputable gaming sites like [Kotaku](https://kotaku.com/skyrim-mod-making-33-000-a-month-accused-of-stealing-c-1832973376), [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/skyrim-script-extender-devs-accuse-skyrim-together-modders-of-stealing-code/), and [EuroGamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-together-code-stealing-controversy-sends-shockwaves-around-the-modding-community) covered the fallout. With one fell sweep, the project had lost all credibility and with it also roughly half their Patreon subscribers.

The initial response? Tempers flared. The Skyrim Team was outraged the SKSE Team went directly public with the accusations instead of settling it in private. Arguments ensued. Bans were issued. Keyboards were smashed. Tears were probably shed, I dunno.

What followed next was what always follows after a large controversy: **damage contro**l.

The devs of Skyrim Together set out to work on shredding evidence, deleting chat histories and posts and comments within their own subreddits and on Discord that so much as hinted at stolen code. **Radio silence** was implemented. When the silence was broken almost a month later, it was to issue the official story that **the code was leftover remnants from back when they used Skyrim Online as a base**, and that nobody could quite explain why it was still there and why it remained uncredited.

When radio silence was finally broken it was to issue [a public apology](https://web.archive.org/web/20190719115507/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bj1GMLKDCRGStIzb9OOXJVKie8pY0pd8C1DF-abZN_M/edit#heading=h.vc5pwpqpsjmp) in which they among other things attempted to explain how it came to this, elaborate on the financial aspect of the Patreon account, and of course restate their respect for the SKSE Team.  And all things considered, it did seem genuine. Users at the time weren't so quick to buy their apology, and of course the entire financial aspect left a bitter taste in most people's mouths such that they abandoned their hopes in the project. But all-in-all the main conflict between SKSE and Skyrim Together pretty much died down.

&gt;***Note***: in defence of the Skyrim Team **-** the official statement of leftover code was seemingly genuine and the team would later report that the code played a very minimal role and did not set the project back at all. Furthermore, the funds were never touched and in fact an accountant was on board who ensured the whole thing was legal.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the time of course, nobody really was aware of this and we all know HobbyDrama happens like wildfire. It was too late; the sparks had already been set ablaze.

Anyway, while the code-related drama died down, the controversy would not end here. See, though the **Beta Version** was almost immediately pulled (so that the Skyrim Together team could rework it) **the hordes of religious fanatics who had followed the mod for years were not so willing to let the mod die**. The vast majority of users were willing to overlook everything that had transpired. So strong was the desire for a Skyrim Multiplayer mod! Their biggest fear was that the project would be scrapped completely now that it was so very close to reality.

The community had essentially been split into two factions - albeit the second faction being a small but extremely vocal minority. On the one hand you had the modders who decided the project was tainted and would not receive their support moving on. On the other you had the fanatics who were fed up with ""stupid drama"" within the community that was destroying the future of Skyrim modding. Why couldn't everyone just be chill about this for a damn second and pretend like it was no big deal?

They'd waited 8 years for this and they weren't going to let a stupid controversy get in the way of getting what they felt they rightfully deserved. Death threats were allegedly issued. It was a clusterfuck, to put it poignantly.

After an eternity of radio silence and faced with constant badgering from the community, the lead developer Yamashi, fed up with the feelings of entitlement, lashed out saying the project ""[owes the community nothing](https://segmentnext.com/community-toxicity-may-shut-down-fan-made-skyrim-multiplayer-mod-says-developer/)"", which led to another wave of controversy.

See, while from a technical standpoint the statement was true seeing as the team had never promised regular updates nor a set release date (and that this was just a passion project), at the time they were  still making 18000 USD a month, which painted the statement in very (very) poor light. Yet again, the Skyrim Together Team was caught in the crossfire. Notable gaming sites covered the event again, YouTube awoke and spewed out videos documenting the newest chains in the drama. Basically a whole repeat of the events of the first drama.

[Another public apology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PyGAJk_8kYUz0WxiRqUf1d7rQ5t6pjgt1tPud7CesXU/preview) was issued, which not only touched upon the events of the last months but also attempted to clarify some things - most notably that ""the comment"" was aimed towards the toxic members of the community and was in no way a shared feeling towards the entire community who had been supportive to them. The document also clarified things  about how they would move forward.

# Skyrim Together Reborn

Which brings us to the present day.

While the project never truly died out (the community's dream of having a multiplayer experience would never have allowed for that), it did lose much of its momentum with regards to public hype and excitement over the project, and the team's reputation never did quite recover (more on that later).

Having taken the criticisms of the project to heart, it seems the mod underwent a bit of a reconstruction of sorts. While Yamashi seems to have stayed on the team, the rest of the team was replaced with new members. As already mentioned, the code itself was pretty quickly rewritten in such a way that there were no longer any similarities to the SKSE code, and they eventually did what the community had pushed them to do for years and made the project open-source in the name of transparency and credibility, while also dismantling the paywall.

And now 5 years since the project's original inception the mod was finally released to moderately enthusiastic acclaim (while the mod seems to work fairly well for some users, others do report it still being fairly buggy and unplayable in the current state).

What started as an innocent attempt at creating every Skyrim player's biggest dreams became a sticky mess of accusations but against all odds the project redeemed itself (kind of) and managed to achieve their goal.

Now as to how much of an effect did the controversy really have on the community? I do feel like the whole debacle left quite an impression. It set a precedent for what NOT to do when handling a project of this size and underlined the importance of open-source work and public communication. On top of that, the modding community had always been mistrusting of modders who use Patreon to accept donations and this event only made them more suspicious. An unintended side-effect is that a separate project released for another Elder Scrolls game received some very well-deserved attention and praise: at the time, comparisons were often drawn to Morrowind's own multiplayer mod using **OpenMW** (an open-source Morrowind project) and users were quick to point out this is how you do a project of this scale properly. *This* was a trustworthy and credible project that truly had the communitys best wishes in mind.

&gt;***Note#1***: OpenMW remains one of the greatest and most promising Morrowind project at the moment and is arguably responsible for a renewed interest in the game as it allows for better compatibility with modern operating systems and enables (among other things) users to play the game on their phones.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Note#2:*** The Morrowind multiplayer mod known as TES3MP was not without controversy as well. That's a whole different story. Depending on how this post is received I may one day cover that too.

I guess the biggest consequence is obviously the fact that this whole thing resulted in a dramatic loss of momentum to a project that was so close to fruition. NOT loss of momentum in terms of setbacks, but in terms of public perception - I feel like a large portion of modders struck the mod from their ""interested"" list. What had until that point been the most anticipated Skyrim mod became a topic people didn't want to touch anymore. The whole situation showcased how ugly passion projects become when money gets involved. And it also revealed a lot about the Skyrim modding community as a whole and reminded the community that there are not only good users but also the toxic and entitled ones among them (though to be fair we don't need much reminding on this, they are an ever-present and vocal bunch).

And as mentioned, despite the new team, the project's reputation never did quite recover. When people mention the mod, a retelling of the events I just described to you almost always follows. Upon [announcing](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/vp5yis/skyrim_together_reborn_release_announcement/?sort=confidence) the ""reborn"" release 7 months ago, one of the first and most-upvoted comments was the question: ""What's the relationship between this team and the original Skyrim Together?"" The stains of the past were not so easily washed away, it seems. In fact very recently the same team has announced they are working on a multiplayer mod for Hogwarts Legacy (which pretty much just came out) - and it also didn't take long before the Skyrim Together Controversy was [brought up](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/111dsqa/comment/j8h0df8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) in the Harry Potter community and left users wondering if this project would go the same path.

2023-02-26,1677435493,"Outlook From a Developer [Long]","There's a lot of opinions floating around about the state of KSP2, along with what I would consider to be some very basic understanding of software development, optimization, and multiplayer technology. As a Software Developer and someone with extensive experience in the Unity engine (including in building planet-scale rendering and voxel systems) I'd just like to throw in my two cents.

Edit: I'll make it clear that we do not know for a fact that there is not a separate dev branch or similar which could reduce these concerns. I would be very happy if the KSP2 team came out in full transparency and showed us what they have. It would be good for community goodwill, and give us an idea of where we are. So far a lot of claims of data mining have been made, however I have not seen any low-level code that refutes these concerns. Assets are not code, and high-level code is not gameplay.

**Let's start with the objectively good:**

KSP2 has a lot of things that will be simple to fix. Issues like ridiculous polygon counts on particle effects, poorly optimized meshes, and similar issues will likely be fixed quickly. These are still concerning - a major studio should know better than to allow these mistakes, even in an early release. There is a lot that has been overlooked, which doesn't scream great things about the development process, but it will be easy to fix, so I'll consider it a good thing.

**Now, let's get to the bad part:**

A lot of people here think that a game is like an onion, and that you can just toss layers on top of layers. Multiplayer networking? Throw it on later. Multithreading optimizations? Throw it on later! But alas, the programming community is here to tell you that there are very specific design patterns we used from the very beginning of development when we want to support these features.

**The Engine:**

Unlike some people, I don't hate Unity. But people need to understand there are structural limitations to the engine that were certainly known beforehand which make it a somewhat poor choice (as vanilla, will explain more on that later) for a game like Kerbal Space Program.

Problems like floating precision errors will likely come up in any engine - if you don't know what this means, it's basically that most engines use 32-bit floating-point data structures to represent positions, which means at very large distances (in Unity, actually about 10km iirc) physics start to break down. There are just not enough bits to store precise numbers that are so large. Games can use tricks to get around this, at the price of performance and gameplay. One of these solutions is using a floating origin, where the player is considered the center of the universe. The only issue with this approach is that it makes multiplayer very complex - you're working with people whose clients both have very different numbers for the positions and physics of everything in the game. These tricks also have some very obvious pop-in for most implementations - in the original KSP, you can clearly see when different systems pop in and out to handle different distance scales. I'm actually quite neutral here - there are downsides to other solutions like using 64-bit precision or fixed numbers. Notably, there's a performance cost to that as well. Smaller data types can fit more easily into CPU cache. I would simply worry about what the choice here says about other planned features - like multiplayer.

A major issue, from what I have seen, is that there has been little (or no) replacement of the base Unity physics. Enterprise customers of Unity can get source access to the engine, which allows teams to modify it directly and fit the engine to their needs. At the scale of Take Two, they certainly had this option available to them. Considering the physics issues are one of the core reasons claimed for building a new game, the fact that the same physics issues are popping up now is a huge red flag. You can't just rip out a physics engine and replace it with a new one. Everything built on top of that engine will act differently and need to be replaced as well. And that will take time and energy I'm not sure will ever be deemed worth it now.  


Let's talk about multithreading. Unity (apart from DOTS, which is a new system that could have been used for performance, but in defense of the team is very poorly supported right now) sucks at handling multithreading. You can multithread your own systems, but any base Unity engine features (other than a select few) need to be run on the main thread. For example, I can generate a list of vertices and calculate normals for a piece of terrain on a seperate thread, but the moment I want to actually apply that mesh to a GameObject (Unity's base object system), the game is going to have to use the main thread. This makes multithreading an issue you absolutely have to plan beforehand. You have to balance your threads and coordinate when they finally hand data to the main thread to ensure that there is no locking of the main thread (which you feel as lag). It is extremely time consuming and rage-inducing to start with a system that is not properly multithreaded and work backwards - a lot of the time, developers find it easier to just start over.

Now let's talk about networking. One of the biggest promises that shook the KSP world was the announcement of multiplayer. Designing a game for multiplayer, again, requires thought from the absolute beginning, especially for a game so heavily dependent on physics. This is before considering that Unity is in somewhat of an internal mess in their networking scene - constantly announcing and scrapping multiplayer systems. It's an absolute nightmare. We have to seriously hope that the work done to this point was done with network sync in mind - but from looking at the code digging that has been done so far, I'm concerned. Sure, that stuff could be held on a different version they are keeping private for now. But we should absolutely be seeing the foundation already in place.

Edit: I have been shown some code snippets which display things like ability to log into an account in-game. I have yet to see any low-level multiplayer code for things like sync, so be on the lookout for that.

We're now talking about multiple systems that had to be designed from the start with each other in mind which all seem to have been neglected. This bodes very poorly for the future.

**Comparisons:**

I have seen a lot of comparisons between KSP2 at launch and No Man's Sky. I don't think this is a realistic comparison at all. No Man's Sky may have been buggy and lacked a ton of features, but they had an extremely strong codebase to build off of. Their solution to precision issues was elegant, the multithreading completely integrated into the game, and the multiplayer code was baked into the foundation. For No Man's Sky, their custom engine (which was probably the majority of their development time) was an engineering beauty, allowing for the gameplay features to be easily designed on top with the support of a firm foundation. That's where you want to be in early access - a position where you can say ""Well, we don't have the features. But we have a damn good foundation which will make quickly adding new features easy.""

**Price:**

Edit: I'll say this section is personal opinion, since some of you have pointed out it detracts from technical discussion. I *personally* feel the following, but I am aware different people have different standards for pricing and Early Access. I'd like to add one thing: The KSP2 team set their own hype level. They could have tapered down expectations far earlier than a couple of weeks before release, and I feel the marketing material was (and is) misleading. Even ads on YouTube now are... not very representative of the state of the game.

The price is a joke, guys. Seriously. I don't even have much to say here, because if anyone is arguing that $50 is a fair price for what is basically a tech demo, jeez. I get it, KSP was rough in the beginning. But that was a tiny team without heaps of funding and a strong fanbase. There have been years at this point. It's honestly disrespectful for them to gaslight the community by going ""well guys it's early access! Did we mention it's early access? Sure, our trailer and (obviously fake) early gameplay footage was completely misleading, but we totally plan to add those things after you pay us the equivalent of a full-price AAA game!"" Mix in the regional pricing, the hype train built with YouTubers (who are likely afraid of saying anything too negative because you have to remember, that could kill their chances of being flown around the country for the next advertising blitz) and we just have a dumpster fire.

**But It's Not Too Late:**

I have actually seen projects come back from worse. But it won't be easy. The KSP2 team needs to seriously consider taking the time and overhauling a lot of what they have built. They need to focus on the engine, on building a stronger foundation to get those future features to stand on later. But I'm going to be realistic and say that the publisher is likely going to force them to do the opposite: Keep throwing features onto a stack that will eventually implode when they have to be honest and say that features like multiplayer just are not capable of being supported.

Only with more rape.

**Part 1: There Is a House Above the World, Where the Over-People Gather**

Its weird to think about in the era of Marvel Cinematic Universe supremacy, but for decades, the Justice League were *the* big superhero team. Oh, the Avengers were there, but they were a team whose major players were Captain America, Iron Man, and The Hulk at a time when the X-Men and Spider-Man were the biggest draws at Marvel (can you remember a time when Spider-Man wasnt on the Avengers? Pepperidge Farm remembers). The Justice League, on the other hand, was *the* consolidation of the heavy hitters at DC Comics. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and& some other guys. Which is not to clown on the contributions of Green Lantern, The Flash, and Aquaman (God knows Aquaman gets clowned on enough). Its just to emphasize that there was a time when the Justice League had *name power* behind it, especially backed up by cartoons like *Super Friends* and the Paul Dini/Bruce Timm DCAU series. 

In the comics, however, the Justice League has had a variety of different tones over the years. In the Sixties and Seventies, it was a good team-up book that sometimes had the heroes deal with crises they couldnt solve on their own, but which also had them run into threats that just sort of fell between the cracks of their respective titles. When not dealing with big team-ups of their own rogues like the Legion of Doom, they would deal with villains that were more Justice League villains, like the perception-/dimension-warping The Key and the light-bending Dr. Light (pay attention to that last one, hell be regretfully important later). In the Eighties, following a best-not-talked-about *Justice League: Detroit* run, the League took on a more comedic tone with *Justice League International*, which was effectively a work-com paired with a superhero book, as Batman had to run herd on more comedic heroes like Blue Beetle and Booster Gold while taking marching orders from stock Eighties business mogul/mental manipulator Maxwell Lord. The Nineties era shifted the League to a more epic, widescreen focus, with the League taking on world-ending threats on grand scale with each story arc under Grant Morrisons pen. Heck, based on the fact that Morrison was still talking to Mark Millar at this time, you can probably draw a direct line from Morrisons *JLA* to Millars *Ultimates*, which in turn was a stated influence on the entire MCU. 

The Justice League wasnt just a collection of A-listers, of course. Over the years, it would pick up heroes who didnt quite have their own titles or whose titles didnt last long, people who filled niches that the big Leaguers couldnt. A few of them will be especially relevant to todays proceedings, such as:

* **The Elongated Man** (Ralph Dibny) and his wife, Sue. Ralph is a private investigator who has the ability to stretch his body like rubber. While hes a strong deductive mind, his wife Sue is an equal partner in his investigations. Think Nick and Nora Charles, if Nick was more sober and could extend his neck down a city block.   
* **Zatanna** (Zatanna Zatara), stage magician who can actually do magic. Casts spells by talking backwards, major fishnets enthusiast, and Paul Dinis No. 1 crush.   
* **Firestorm** (Ronnie Raymond/Martin Stein), an amalgamation of a high school football player and a brilliant physicist who can control nuclear energy and transmute any substance on a fundamental level. The major rate-limiting step is that Ronnie is usually in the drivers seat, so he has to basically have Martin whisper to him how to play with the building blocks of the universe.  
* **The Atom** (Ray Palmer), a scientist with the ability to shrink himself down to microscopic size. As Zatanna is the teams all-purpose magic expert, The Atom often serves as the teams all-purpose science expert.  
* The villainous **Dr. Light** (Dr. Arthur Light), briefly mentioned above. In his origins, Dr. Light was someone who keep the entire League busy just by himself, a creator of illusions and hard-light constructs (like Green Lantern, only less chromatic). After this, he had a slow, long downfall where he ended up a punching bag of various superhero teams. There was also a period where he was on the Suicide Squad, killed a kid for reminding him of getting dunked on by the Teen Titans, was haunted by a colleague he killed, died, went to Hell, came back a ghost... anyway, this guy has gone through it. 
* The heroic **Dr. Light** (Kimiyo Hoshi), an astronomer who gets light-bending powers as a result of DCs biggest crossover, the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Once the dust clears, she ends up on the team during the *Justice League International* run as the newbie, trying to find her place among the big leagues. 

The Justice League has shifted tones, focuses, and rosters many times over the years. Heroes join, heroes leave, heroes go to Detroit, Batman once said Fuck this, I quit and started his own team with blackjack and hookers. But at the dawn of the 21st century, the League was about to get a bit darker and deal with the skeletons in its closet. And we all have one man to thank for that&

**Part 2: Damnit, DiDio**

If youve read any DC Comics related post on this subreddit, you are no doubt well, well aware of the reputation of Dan DiDio, DC Comics Editor in Chief, destroyer of teen sidekicks, and engineer of grimdark. Under his reign& 

* Batfamily member Stephanie Brown/Spoiler died in an extremely controversial arc and ended up in a big game of keepaway even after she came back
* [Other Batfamily member Cassandra Cain/Batgirl went from teen assassin seeking redemption who is barely literate and verbal to monologuing dragon lady who revels in evil and ended up in an even bigger game of keepaway from the Batgirl title even after she came back to the side of the angels](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/pdue0e/american_comicsdc_comics_the_saga_of_cassandra/). 
* Yet *another* Batfamily member Dick Grayson/Nightwing/the original goddamn Robin was almost killed off in the Infinite Crisis event because it was believed that his character progression aged Batman, and it took a creator revolt to avert that (not that it stopped Dick from undergoing several character loop-de-loops during DiDios reign).  
* Former Teen Flash/current Flash Wally West was strongly sidelined as Barry Allen/the first Flash returned from the Speed Force and went on to [trigger a complete timeline reset for the DC Universe](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/pyvpyo/american_comics_it_was_meeeeee_wally_how_dc/) ([you see? This is why we cant have nice things, Barry! You ASSHOLE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1Imv4Jcnwg&amp;ab_channel=Heretic306) ). 

DiDio joined DC in 2002, so his reign is starting to take off by 2004. Around this time, the Justice League is kind of in status quo mode. Joe Casey has picked up the reins from Morrison and is following in their widescreen style, as well as spinning off a black ops-style title called *Justice League Elite* (somewhat mixed success there). Things are plugging ahead, but there are plans to dig into the roots of the League. Mystery novelist Brad Meltzer, whos already done a short run on *Green Arrow*, pitches the miniseries *Identity Crisis*, a murder mystery that dives into the buried secrets of the JLA.

As you may have picked up from the past comics dramas, crossover events are a regular thing at the Big Two. Although they promise world-shaking events, sometimes they pass with a damp fart. The one that casts the biggest shadow over DC, however, is the *Crisis on Infinite Earths* crossover. Like many people paying attention to pop culture in 2022, DC eventually got a little tired of the idea of the multiverse and had an event that wiped out most other realities, effectively consolidating the heroes to one Earth and providing an opportunity for soft/hard reboots of their backstories. This will be more relevant to what came after *Identity Crisis*, but its important to note that many comics crossovers find themselves chasing the potential of CoIE, trying to trigger a Big Meaningful Change in the status quo. And *Identity Crisis* aimed to do so by examining some of the darker realities of the DC Universe, as well as the skeletons in the closets of its greatest heroes. 

**Part 3: Issue 1, or Murder, She Scorched**

So were just going to cut right to the chase. This series opens with Sue Dibny being brutally murdered. [Her husband Ralph comes home from a patrol to find her body horribly burned. To add even more pathos, shed just found out she was pregnant, and the positive test is found near her remains.](https://i.redd.it/le4xb6zm5etz.jpg) The entire superhero community goes on high alert, and some of the worlds greatest detectives with superhuman talent are stunned that they cant find any real trace evidence at the crime scene. As the community mourns, the members of the Justice League gather together because they have a secret that could be the driving force behind this crime, and no one is safe. They believe the most likely culprit is their old villain, Dr. Light.

Already, the series is off to a rocky start. If youre a casual fan of the DC Universe and were promised a great world-shaking death, the fact that the victim is the wife of someone who was last on the Justice League decades ago (barring the Justice League International throwback miniseries *Formerly Known as the Justice League*) is going to draw shrugs. If youre a dedicated fan, or at least a smart mark who realized they probably werent gonna kill Lois Lane or Alfred Pennyworth for this title, it might still leave a bad taste that this is kicked off by the death of a bright, sassy character from a more mirthful era of the book. Even then, theres the fact that Sues death falls into a trope thats no doubt been beaten to death in the discourse: Women in Refrigerators. 

We probably dont need to go back over the particulars, but the main drive of the Women in Refrigerators trope is that a womans injury, assault, or death is not about *her*, but about *the people around her*. If a woman is assaulted or raped, its not something for her to deal with and process; its something for someone else in her life, usually her male love interest, to avenge. If a woman is murdered, the story isnt focused on her role in the community and the impact of her absence; its about someone else, usually her husband/boyfriend, getting revenge. Sues death is at least a little bit about her, but its more about the community around her. Any superhero loved one could have died to fill the niche; she was just the one who drew the short straw. In a lot of ways, her tragedy was not hers. 

And it was only going to get worse from there.

**Part 4: Issue 2, or The Rape Pages Are In!**

Issue 2 arrives and reveals what the great secret driving the Justice League is. See, for decades, Dr. Light had gone from a powerful threat that required the entire Justice League to stop him, to someone who gets clowned on by the League. And the Teen Titans. And& *checks random Wiki entry*& Little Boy Blue, apparently. Hes still a supervillain, but compared to Lex Luthor or The Joker, hes bush league. So why is he the first suspect for the murder of Sue Dibny? Cue the retcon. 

See, when the entire League was away on a mission, Sue was alone on the JLA Satellite. And when Dr. Light managed to infiltrate the base, he assaulted Sue& and raped her (I'm not linking these pages because why in God's name would I). The League managed to get back before he could kill her, [and they beat the seven shades of shit out of him](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/14/144952/4628568-doctor_light_003.jpg). However, before he went down, Dr. Light threatened to brag about his deeds to other villains and direct them to go after the JLA's loved ones... and because he'd managed to sneak onto the JLA Satellite, he might actually have intel on the heroes and their secret identities. Because they considered themselves superheroes and couldnt just hurl him out an airlock, [the League decided to have Zatanna use her magic to not only make Dr. Light forget everything, but to make him a more harmless villain](https://arousinggrammardotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/catwomanbatmanzatanna18.jpg). Batman, with his strict moral code, objected, [so Zatanna made him forget all about this as well](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5428f934cadb92f1c7f9a1415bd626c4-lq). 

As you can imagine, this was received even more poorly. Not only had Sue been murdered, shed been raped. Not only had she been raped, but shed been raped years ago in the morass that is comic book time and effectively *decades* ago in her publication history, and it had never come up once. Her tragedy was not hers to deal with, nor was it explored in terms of recovery or recognition. It was something that had meaning to her community, meaning to her husband, meaning to her rapist& but not to her. Because, until after she had died, it never was. It was pointed out in some pieces, both at the time and now, that for all that Zatanna was handing out free mindwipes, she apparently never handed one out to Sue. Im not sure if that would have made it better, though. On the one hand, with Sue dead and the rape serving only as a retconned-in postmortem revelation, its not like there was any room to explore what the rape meant to her. On the other hand, having it so that the rape didnt even have meaning *for the victim* would have just underlined how meaningless the whole decision to add rape to her backstory was. 

Making the decision to reveal a character had been a rape survivor for years feels like it should have been handled delicately. And& it was not. If anything, it was allegedly handled with celebration. [Former DC editor Valerie DOrazio](https://annotated-dc.tumblr.com/post/174753645337/identity-crisis-editor-valerie-dorazio-talks) says that DiDio set out to take the smile out of comics. While Meltzer was the author on *Identity Crisis*, the rape was asked for by editorial. In DOrazios account, Sue was chosen because she was pure and because Ralph was corny. [When the pages came in for illustration, an associate editor supposedly rushed into the office yelling, The rape pages are in!](https://bookriot.com/dcs-identity-crisis-15-years-later/)

It should be mentioned that DOrazio left DC Comics after settling a sexual harassment claim with Executive Editor Mike Carlin, who had a hand in *Identity Crisis*. Although Ive tried doing a search to see if Dan DiDio has an alternate account of what went down behind the scenes, Ive come up with nothing, so if anyone has the other side of the story, Id be interested in hearing it. The closest Ive found is [an article recapping a DiDio Facebook post from 2011](https://comicsalliance.com/dc-comics-co-publisher-dan-didio-top-ten-comics-projects/) (a.k.a., [at least 5 years after DOrazio was dropping thinly-veiled posts about how it was his editorial mandate to include the rape](https://occasionalsuperheroine.blogspot.com/2006/11/goodbye-to-comics-7-we-need-rape.html) ) about how he still stood by the controversial book for pitt[ing] hero against hero and set[ting] the tone of things to follow.

Maybe it would set the tone for darkness and paranoia in the DC Universe as a whole to follow. In the book itself, the tone to follow was clown shoes. 

**Part 5: Its So Dumb Its Brilliant. No! Its Just Dumb!**

After the revelation of Sues rape, its probably best to describe the rest of Identity Crisis as things happen. Among these things:

* Ray Palmers ex-wife Jean Loring is attacked next, nearly hanged to death by an unseen assailant (key word is *unseen*, as a pair of hands are shown tying the noose around Jeans neck). Ray manages to arrive in the nick of time to save her, and the two start repairing their relationship during this dangerous time.  
* The villain Deathstroke, who mainly takes on the Teen Titans and whose powers include somewhat heightened reflexes and a sub-Wolverine-level healing factor, manages to fight the entire Justice League to a standstill. At once. Apparently, his great trick to take down The Flash is to aim at where he *will* be, which Im sure the veteran superhero who runs at near the speed of light has never had to account for.   
* Flash villain Captain Boomerang is sent by the mysterious orchestrator of this villainous plot to go kill the dad of Tim Drake, the current Robin. The two manage to kill one another, leaving Tim Drake an orphan, just like Batman.  
* Both Batman and Dr. Light remember exactly what happened back then, and are pissed.   
* Firestorm gets pierced with a magic sword by the villain Shadow-Thief and explodes, racking up the hero body count.

Eventually, the mysterious orchestrator of this sinister plot must be unveiled. And it turns out to be& Jean Loring. She had a duplicate of the same technology Ray uses to shrink, and the League finds out shes the killer when a *second* autopsy of Sue turns up tiny footprints in her brain. Apparently, Jean was very lonely ever since the divorce went through, and as something of a superhero widow, she knew how stressful it could be to be a heros loved one. So, she only intended to give Sue a scare, using Rays favorite trick of shrinking to electron size and traveling through a telephone line (this was when landlines were a thing, remember). However, [she punched too hard on Sues brain and nearly killed her, so she figured she needed to finish the job](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JFzH9mq_mzM/VhQjwlUneSI/AAAAAAAAGLc/Edxmsdl2EjE/s1600/SueDibneyDying.jpg). Wait, wasnt Sues body burned? Oh, yeah, [Jean brought along a flamethrower. Just because](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jK3Ec9p29r4/VhQk_W9QS3I/AAAAAAAAGLk/QkVe-9vVqNo/s1600/JeanLoringFlameThrower.jpg). After that, she figured, why not keep this dog and pony show going, as long as it means the heroes get nice and close to their loved ones again?

So, leaving aside the massive holes in the mystery, this reveal did not land well. In addition to just accepting that the Atoms long-time love interest was nuttier than a squirrel turd, it gave us an overreaching female supervillain whose driving motivation was& not feeling loved. It should be noted this was happening around the same time as Marvels own super-team rattling event *Avengers Disassembled*, where it turned out the secret villain harrowing the Avengers was& the Scarlet Witch, who had been driven mad by regained memories of her children who had never existed (long story, and then those kids ended up existing anyway - comics, everybody). [As writer John Rogers pointed out at the time](http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2005/02/comics-womb-crazy.html), this meant both the Big Two lines had premised crossovers on the idea of female villains who were driven mad by womens issues - love, and motherhood. It was yet another unintentional testimony to a story that didnt give two shits about the interior operations of women.

**Part 6: Everything Changes Forever& for Two Weeks**

So, now that the dust has cleared, what is the immediate fallout of *Identity Crisis*? Well, like with many superhero crossovers, some things that last, some things that are temporary, and some things that are just meant to presage yet another crossover. In summation: 

* Jean Loring is thrown into Arkham Asylum on general grounds of she cray. Later, she ends up possessed by Justice League villain Eclipso. Dont worry about it.  
* Batman loses all trust in the Justice League and starts working on the satellite Brother Eye, an artificial intelligence that is meant to gather information on all individuals with powers. Like any AI more intelligent than Alexa, it eventually goes insane and tries to kill everyone.  
* A new Firestorm comes into being after getting hit with the force that bound together Robbie Raymond and Martin Stein. Meanwhile, the Shadow-Thief goes on trial for the old Firestorms death in the pages of *Manhunter*, in an arc that is derided in comic book legal circles (yes, they exist) for [the prosecution putting forward a case that seems to be 80% witness impact statements by volume](http://comicfacts.blogspot.com/2005/02/manhunter-7-trial-of-shadow-thief.html).

Then theres Dr. Light, whose fate may merit its own drama, as DC Comics took what could have been regrettably cringe in retrospect and short-circuited it with something that was *absolutely* cringe in the moment. See, with Dr. Lights memories returned, he was now being styled as a major threat. After all, he raped one superheros wife, imagine what hell do to your family. Immediately after *Identity Crisis* ends, the new and unimproved Dr. Light shows up in *Teen Titans*, horny for revenge. He nearly manages to take out the entire Titans roster, both current and former members, until someone manages to drain his powers. Hes then sprung by other supervillains, and its clear hes being positioned as a wild card in the supervillain scene. Like The Joker, hes mad, bad, and willing to go the distance, but unlike The Joker, hes actually got superpowers.

Then& comes Judd Winicks run on *Green Arrow*. As part of his new ascendancy, the villainous Dr. Light attacks the heroic Dr. Light, draining a portion of her powers and beating her into a coma. While she convalesces in the hospital, it falls on Green Arrow and Black Lightning to hunt down Dr. Light and get revenge (if youre feeling sick of the whole Women in Refrigerators thing by now, imagine how comics fandom feels). During the chase, Dr. Light manages to get the upper hand and binds up Green Arrow in a hard-light construct, and decides to monologue at him. [About rape](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4414/3429/1600/480911/scan0015.jpg). [He talks about how he raped Sue Dibny](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4414/3429/1600/881863/scan0014.jpg). [He talks about how draining Kimikos power was pretty much like rape](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4414/3429/1600/991359/scan0013%20copy.jpg). [The phrase party in your pants is used](http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/4414/3429/1600/857894/scan0016.jpg). In another pop culture analogue that has aged badly, it becomes clear that Dr. Light is like Handbanana from *Aqua Teen Hunger Force*. All he knows is ball, good& *and rape*. 

And just like that, Dr. Light cant be anything else. Hes not a juggernaut, psycho, murderer, *and* rapist; hes just a rapist. So, thanks to Winick most likely unintentionally fumbling the bag, Dr. Light just becomes a suspicious stain on the DC Universes prom dress. When he next shows up with other supervillains, [hes swiftly clawed by Cheetah](https://i.redd.it/wywph76ooj641.png), who will work alongside tyrants, torturers, and [men who have murdered babies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Manta), but not a rapist. In the pages of Kyle Bakers darkly satirical *Plastic Man*, the title character mentions how Dr. Light was [brought over to do what Dr. Light does to victims now. Like thats Lights new power now.](https://preview.redd.it/comic-excerpt-like-thats-lights-new-power-plastic-man-kyle-v0-3amekabaxl1a1.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=96ee1f5c4545f41097395255fc6e4b3286a5ffed) Dr. Light finally meets his end in *Final Crisis: Revelations*, a miniseries meant to lead into *yet another* crossover event. In the first issue, [the Spectre, DCs spirit of ironic justice, turns Dr. Light into a candle and lights him on fire](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5VgL6ZXwkaw/SKcEIl4-r-I/AAAAAAAAHig/P0RvGwNdZ1w/s1600/Final+Crisis+Revelations+1-2.jpg)& [just as hes about to assault sex workers who are dressed as the Teen Titans](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5VgL6ZXwkaw/SKcEIAlwtzI/AAAAAAAAHiY/eozCRsGKtK0/s1600/Final+Crisis+Revelations+1-1.jpg). 

Comics, everybody!

**Epilogue: Stay Tuned for the Next Episode**

So, in the end, the question becomes, what did *Identity Crisis* mean? Well, in some ways, that has triggered a long-running discussion of what DC Comics mean. To continue on the DiDio beat, the big lead-in to the next crossover after this one was a one-shot issue called *Countdown to Infinite Crisis*. Remember how we mentioned the work-com style hijinks of the *Justice League International* era? Yeah, turns out their money-grubbing, corrupt-in-a-fun-way boss Maxwell Lord has been evil all along. And to sell that point, [he shoots the Blue Beetle, another mainstay of that era, right through the goddamn head](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELXXbMDXYAA0Rnz?format=jpg&amp;name=large). 

Right after this death of fun issue comes *Infinite Crisis*, where it turns out some people from Earths destroyed in *Crisis on Infinite Earths* - namely, an alternate Superman, an alternate Lois Lane, and an alternate Superboy - have survived in a pocket dimension and are trying to restore things to the way they were. Yes, its an entire crossover with the premise of things were better when I was a kid. Mind you, this is not the argument the *creators* are making. Rather, Geoff Johns puts these arguments in the mouth of Superboy-Prime, who it turns out is a psychotic little manchild of mass destruction who believes that any changes made to his superhero paradise have despoiled it. The tone of this series is perfectly captured by [Superboy-Prime yelling YOURE RUINING EVERYTHING! while ripping the arm off of a Teen Titans D-lister](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-495380eec0543d71e6af4b005bd88882.webp). 

From reboot to reboot, crossover to crossover, it seems DC has settled into a running theme for its crossovers as of late, and that is What Comics Mean. This has long been a running thread in comic books, from the pages of Neil Gaimans *The Sandman* to the famous [These no nonsense solutions of yours just don't hold water in a complex world of jet-powered apes and time travel](http://johnnycompton.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/JLA-Classified-3-Complex-World-03.png) panel in *JLA Classified*. But these days, it seems the big events of DC keep being about what comics mean, from an unending tribute to how stories are awesome in *Dark Knights: Death Metal* to the underlying theme of Christ, do we really need *another* reboot? in *Dark Crisis*. While DC has decided to take the Fuck it, well do it live approach to canon as of *Infinite Frontier* and allows for a world where all stories are possible at once, it still seems that the line is stuck in an unceasing tug of war about what its comics mean, whether the world is to be finite or infinite, dark or light, heroic or compromised.

But its clear that, at one time or another, it was about being excited when the rape pages came in.

[P.S. If you want a happy ending to the ""Ralph and Sue Dibny"" part of this story, when the New 52 reboot happened, Gail Simone - the woman who coined Women In Refrigerators - got to write a new edition of her villains as heroes series *Secret Six*, where the original character Big Shot - originally portrayed as a big, hulking, classical galoot - turns out to be Ralph in disguise, using his stretching powers to look like a wall of beef. He eventually tracks down and reunites with Sue, and nobody has decided to fuck that one up yet.]","HobbyDrama",235,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11f9bev/dc_comics_lets_wipe_a_smile_off_that_face/"

Recently in the pokemon rom hack community lots of people have been discussing the polish of a very popular hack: Pokemon Radical Red, that aims to increase the difficulty of the older games.

From what I have heard nothing has come from them or they were just nonsense like the stories with Travis Hunter and Barstool but that hasn't stopped the rumors from being in the media.

Then today there was an interview where Deion made some comments about his recruiting tactics and what he looks for.

It was controversial enough for Deion to land the nations top recruit at JSU which led to tons of accusations about possible violations. But now with him at a major D1 where he will be recruiting head to head with the best in the country and we know that the big schools do not play fair. We have all heard the stories from the SEC recruiting wars, Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh paying for hamburgers for recruits and other major violations. Add in the chaos of the transfer portal and NIL madness and it is just a matter of time before someone gets nailed for major violations.

I am not saying he will actually be guilty of violations but given his flashy media style, his YouTube presence, his lack of a filter in the things he says and IF Colorado is successful at landing a major recruiting class it won't take long for the top schools to take notice and for the rumors and allegations to ramp up. The media will make it a huge controversy and the NCAA will have to investigate.

Lawmakers across the country have filed hundreds of pieces of anti-transgender legislation for the 2023 session, setting out to further marginalize a community of people who already faced a year of unprecedented violence and threats to their existence.

While the media often portrays the anti-LGBTQ+ mission of Americas rightwing elements as part of a culture war, some members of the community, allies, and activists argue that it is best described as a (state) government-sponsored genocidefar from a nebulous battle of ideas and values. Depending on what state one lives in, various expressions of LGBTQ+ identity are actively being legislated out of existence and criminalized. Transgender individuals, in particular, are being stripped of rights at an alarming rate by lawmakers beholden to rightwing propaganda campaigns. Working in concerteither intentionally or unintentionallywith far-right extremists, this combination amounts to a coordinated attempt to eradicate the transgender community from wide swaths of the nation.

#Gender affirming care

*Definition: Gender-affirming care is a model of care which includes a spectrum of social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individuals gender identity.*

One of the strongest examples of how anti-transgender laws can be considered a form of genocide are bills that ban gender affirming care. Pay special attention to part (b) in the following definition:

The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [defines](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) genocide as any acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; **(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group**; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Legislators in 37 states have filed bills that prohibit gender affirming care in various forms and for various age groups. If successful, their states will join the [four](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/youth-access-to-gender-affirming-care-the-federal-and-state-policy-landscape/) that previously banned gender affirming care for minors.

These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 

* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.

* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.

Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.

Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 

&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.

* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.

* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.

#Child Abuse

Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.

In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 

&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.

Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 

* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 

* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.

* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.

* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide

Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 

Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.

The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.

##Classification

Definition: Division of us and them

Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi

Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.

These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 

Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.

##Dehumanization

Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group

Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin

During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 

The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 

Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.

After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 

&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.

&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 

###Drag performances

Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 

Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.

* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.

* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.

* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/"

2023-02-19,1676815493,"Our bodies can develop natural immunity to viruses we are exposed to without ever becoming sick. The pharmaceutical industry wants people to forget what was once common knowledge.","The industry wants people to think we *need* injections to remain healthy.  The industry's most successful business model is to convince people that their natural immunity is insufficient.

Our immune systems can be greatly strengthened with wise dietary and lifestyle choices, but the industry wants you to forget that and pay for ""treatments"" instead. 

This article from 2011 talks about natural immunity and how ***about half of us develop immunity to viruses we are exposed to without ever becoming ""infected"" or ""sick""***. 

&gt;Why do some people end up in bed feverish, hacking and sneezing for days from the flu  when others seem to never get sick?

&gt;To answer that question, University of Michigan researchers did the first study of its kind: They infected 17 healthy people with the flu virus and discovered that **everyone who is exposed to the flu actually is affected by it, but their bodies just have a different way of reacting to it**. Half of the study participants got sick; the other half didnt notice a thing.


&gt;Many people might conclude that if you are exposed to a virus and you dont get sick, its because the virus didnt stick or it was so weak, it just passed right through your system and your system didnt notice. Thats not a correct notion, says Alfred Hero, professor at the University of Michigan College of Engineering and author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal PLoS Genetics.
He continues, **There is an active immune response which accounts for the resistance of certain people getting sick, and that response is just as active as the response we all know and hate, which is being sick with the sniffles, fever, coughing and sneezing. Its just that the responses are different.**

&gt;Hero, along with scientists from Duke University Medical Center and the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences &amp; Policy, studied participants gene expression to watch how the immune system reacted to the flu virus. The analysis reviewed 22,000 genes and 267 blood samples, and used a pattern recognition algorithm and several other methods to discover the genomic signatures associated with the immune response in people who get flu symptoms and those who do not. 

&gt;They found significant and complex immune responses in the people who got sick ***and the people who didnt***. Scientists noticed changes in their blood 36 hours before some people actually felt sick. Although they understand that some peoples immune systems resist the virus, they still dont know how or why that happens.

&gt;There is a behind the scene active immune response even when you dont get sick, Hero says. What we found were differences in their biological metabolism and gene expression. These differences had to do with antioxidants.

Here's a little bit about Greg:

&gt; Greg Jennings is a former American football wide receiver who played in the National Football League for ten seasons, primarily with the Green Bay Packers. He played college football at Western Michigan and was selected by Green Bay in the second round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He is a member of the Packers Hall of Fame, where he was a Super Bowl Champion and 2x Pro Bowler.

&gt; Greg is a faithful father of four who has committed his post-career life to helping other men prioritize their health. As men, he knows that we often focus on putting the team on our back and not on ourselves, so its his mission to help men be healthy enough to live a long and happy life with their families.

The purpose of the AMA tonight is to help the Packers community. While Greg loved his playing days and will answer questions about them, his main hope is that you all will gain better knowledge about how to prioritize your health now that we can take a break from drinking every Sunday. He appreciated how faithfully youve rooted for him and wants to ensure you are around long enough to keep the Packer tradition alive with your grandkids.

That said, it is an AMA, so even though fitness will be prioritized, everything is on the table.

2023-02-17,1676594853,"Vendors who support homophobia: A list","Hi all,

Some of you may be aware of a certain Michigan wedding venue, The Broadway Avenue, which is [currently being penalized by the city of Grand Rapids for refusing to offer service to LGBTQ couples](https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2022/10/anti-lgbtq-wedding-venue-becomes-first-to-be-penalized-under-grand-rapids-2019-law.html?outputType=amp). This has resulted in no self-reflection or change on their part and instead resulted in an insta post doubling down on their homophobic, discriminatory beliefs, which also happened to draw a lot of homophobic vendors out of the woodwork. The vendors below have all commented support for the venue on said post. I collected all the account names into one placeif youre planning a wedding in or around MI, feel free to skim through to see if a vendor youre considering is a homophobe. Its hard enough to choose vendors, thought Id help yall weed some out.

He decided to call me out for my very rude comment in his stories and said we should respect others beliefs.

2023-02-24,1677207763,"On September 5, 1936, 1-year-old Harry Browe was abducted from Detroit, Michigans Clark Park. Sadly, despite hundreds of tips and even several promising leads, he was never found. What happened to Harry?","On September 5, 1936, around 4:30pm, brothers Charles Browe, age 9, Edward Browe, age 7, and Harry Buddy Browe, age 19 months, departed from their Detroit, Michigan home to go to the park. While pushing Harry in his stroller, the three siblings walked from their house at 1468 17th Street, to Clark park, located approximately fourteen blocks away.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 6:30pm, a woman, accompanied by two young girls, approached Charles and Edward while they were playing on a set of swings with a small group of other children. According to the boys, the woman began immediately doting on young Harry, whose stroller was positioned next to the swings. After a brief conversation, the woman offered to pay for ice cream for all three of the Browe children and watch Harry.

&amp;#x200B;

With money in hand, Charles and Edward walked to a nearby confectionary to purchase the ice cream. After they returned and finished their cones, again the woman offered Charles money, this time to purchase candy. The woman instructed Edward to watch Charles as he crossed the street to ensure he safely made it across. Edward did so, however did not enter the store. Instead, he remained just outside the door. When Charles exited the store, Edward was suddenly in possession of three pennies. When Charles questioned where he got them, he explained a man walked up and gave them to him for more candy. The pair decided against buying more treats however and returned to the park.

&amp;#x200B;

As Charles and Edward approached the swings where they had left their baby brother, they found Harrys stroller empty. After a quick scan of the playground, they quickly realized that both the woman, and Harry, were gone. Approximately three hours after they had set out for the park, Charles and Edward returned home with the empty stroller, explaining to their parents, Robert, 35, and Alice, 27, what had happened. The Browes immediately summoned police.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles and Edward described the woman to investigators as being in her 30s, slightly heavy set, with blonde hair and glasses. She was wearing a blue and white dress, no stockings, and black shoes. They described the two young girls in her company as being around 7 and 11 years old. Both wore dresses, one brown, the other blue, and the pair donned matching black shoes and yellow stockings. The man who had given Edward the three pennies was described as having a cleft palate and dressed in a gray hat and dark suit.

The Browes could think of no reason anyone would want to abduct young Harry. The family lived in a modest, weathered home, and had no real money to speak of. While Robert worked as a steel worker, Alice was a homemaker who cared for their six children, which besides Charles, Edward, and Harry, included Robert Jr, age 4, Marion, age 3, and Irene, age 3 months.

Investigators thoroughly questioned young Charles and Edward on the chance the boys were lying about that evening's events. While the pair did mention Harry had fallen out of his stroller on the way to the park, they claimed he was uninjured. After several rounds of interrogation, detectives were confident the boys were telling the truth. 

Also questioned were two playmates of the Browe children who were present at the park that evening. Accompanied by their mother, Dolores and Joan Gallagher, ages 4 and 11, relayed the same story of a woman dressed in blue taking Harry. Another woman who was also at the park, told police she saw a man carrying Harry in his arms a short time after he vanished. She gave a similar description of the man who had given Edward the additional money for treats. 

An all out search quickly ensued with scores of police, volunteers, and even the local Boy Scouts aiding in the hunt for Baby Harry. Sadly, they found no sign of the missing infant, nor his supposed abductors. In the hopes to increase their search area, ten thousand circulars were distributed in several states. The flyers offered a reward of 650 dollars, and included a description of Harry; Age: 19 months, height: 2 ft 4 in, weight: 26 lbs, blue eyes, light brown/dark blonde hair. Wore: white romper, no stockings, black shoes.

The circular also included Harry had a missing fingernail on his left ring finger as well as a pair of unique, and prominent scars located behind each of his ears. Only three months prior to Harrys disappearance, he had undergone a mastoidectomy, a surgery that removes diseased cells from the air-filled spaces in your mastoid bone. The scars were a result of said surgery. 

Hundreds of tips poured in from people who claimed to have seen the missing child, including from nearby Indiana, and as far away as Canada. According to one man, he was confident he had seen Harry at a small gas station in Goshen, Indiana in the company of a man and woman driving a car with Michigan plates. Another call placed Harry in Evansville, Indiana, and yet another in Indianapolis. Investigators even traveled to Toronto, Canada to inspect babies participating in a rather unusual event called the Great Stork Derby, a contest held from 1926 to 1936 in which female residents of Toronto competed to produce the most babies in 10 years, in order to qualify for a bequest in a will of a millionaire who hosted the event. Sadly all of the leads proved to either be prank calls, or resulted in dead ends. 

Harrys grief stricken parents did everything in their power to get the word out about him. Alice went as far away as New York City to speak on a nationwide radio show, while Robert appealed to the kidnappers to leave the baby with any clergyman. He expressed his concern the kidnappers may not return Harry due to the constant onslaught of curiosity seekers that surrounded their house. In their desperation, the Browes even spoke to a psychic multiple times in the hopes she could offer some insight about the whereabouts of their missing baby. 

In the following days, and as any promising leads began to dwindle, a clue finally presented itself in the form of a postcard. On September 11th, Alice received a picture postcard from Detroit in the mail. The letter read in part;

Mrs Browe, 

Please forgive me for taking your baby. You cannot understand how it is to be without one. You have so many, surely you can spare this one. He is beginning to like us, we want you to know&.

The postcard was written in a female's handwriting and bore a purposely torn corner. According to investigators, it was not uncommon for kidnappers to use this method as a way of proving the identity of a baby later if their appearance had changed. However, this method was normally reserved for ransom cases, and the Browes had received no such request. Although investigators believed the letter may be legitimate, the writer was never found. 

In 1950, tragedy again struck the Browe family. While walking one evening, Alice and Robert were struck by an oncoming vehicle. Sadly Alice passed away at the scene, while Robert suffered several severe injuries including a broken pelvis and internal bleeding. Alices death left Robert to care for their children, which by this time had risen to 12 in number. However, left with debilitating injuries from the accident, Robert was unable to continue working. A short time later Robert and his children moved in with Alices mother, Marion. 

In 1952, Charles took a job driving a gasoline truck, using the money he earned to help his family as much as possible. Sadly, that year the Browes were hit with another devastating loss when Charles' truck collided with another vehicle, killing him instantly. In December 1952, Marion also passed away. That same month, a devastating fire destroyed a portion of the familys home leaving them without heat. Finally after a lengthy battle with the insurance company however, Robert was appointed the administrator of Marions meager estate. 

In 1962, a new promising lead came from a young man who believed himself to be Harry. Reporter Neal Shine, who as a child had been a former playmate of Charles and Edward and had written several first hand accounts of their demeanor after the disappearance, received a phone call one evening. The young man on the other end claimed to have seen the story about Harry, and was concerned he may be the missing boy. He was the same age, had blue eyes, bore scars behind each of his ears, and perhaps most compelling of all, told of a deathbed confession from the woman he believed to be his mother. According to the young man before her death she had told him You are some other womans baby. I took you. I have never been sorry, except for breaking that womans heart. 

After several phone calls between the two, the man told Neal he had decided he didnt want to complicate his life if it were true. Neal, however, took it upon himself to look for the young man, who he believed from their conversations, worked in a hotel kitchen. For six months Neal searched every hotel kitchen he could, hunting for a young man with scars behind his ears, however he found none. 

Robert passed away only two years later in 1964. Edward, in 1986. From what I have gathered, all but two of Harrys siblings have also since passed. There are, however, still members of his family actively seeking Harry, who today, would be in his late 80s. Their only hope is to finally have an answer to the question that has plagued their family all these years; What Happened To Harry?

School of Education and this kid really said Oh education? That kind of an easy major not many people applied probably We kind of went on for a while about how some majors are Easy and some are hard and it was just making me really upset.

Christina lived in Redford Township at the time of her disappearance. She was last seen between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on March 19, 1983, walking westbound on 5 Mile Road near Lola Park in Redford Township.

Her body was found 10 days later, on March 29, 1983, on state-owned land near the intersection of Fisher and Faussett roads. Her body was found after a heavy snowfall and the start of the snow melting.

Charles David Shaw has been identified has her murderer. Shaw lived about 5 miles from where she vanished near Livonia (Michigan). Shaw died in November of 1983 - he died of autoerotic asphyxia. His widow is still alive and provided a lot of information to LE about his behavior in the months leading up to and after the murder.

[Season of Justice](https://seasonofjustice.org/) provided funding for the DNA analysis which lead to the discovery of her killer.  


There was no known relationship between Christina and Shaw. 

I don't know if her parents are still around, but her sister attended today's press conference.

###Poisonous gasses

A Norfolk Southern freight train that derailed along the Ohio-Pennsylvania border on February 3 spewed millions of pounds of toxic materials into the environment, killing wildlife, pets, and forcing evacuations.

Five of the cars carried vinyl chloride, a potent carcinogen used in the production of plastic material. While this is bad enough in itself, in order to avoid a potential explosion emergency crews released the vinyl chloride from the tankers and set it aflame ([video](https://youtu.be/dA09r6oOR4M))turning the chemical into phosgene and hydrogen chloride. Phosgene is a colorless nonflammable gas so poisonous that it was used extensively as a [chemical weapon](https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/a-brief-history-of-chemical-war) during World War I. 

&gt;Phosgene, which smells like moldy hay, is also an irritant but six times more deadly than chlorine gas. Phosgene is also a much stealthier weapon: its colorless, and soldiers did not at first know they had received a fatal dose. After a day or two, victims lungs would fill with fluid, and they would slowly suffocate in an agonizing death. Although the Germans were the first to use phosgene on the battlefield, it became the primary chemical weapon of the Allies. Phosgene was responsible for 85% of chemical-weapons fatalities during World War I.

* Other toxic chemicals released by the derailment [include](https://abcnews.go.com/US/toxic-chemicals-train-derailed-ohio-originally-reported-data/story?id=97080179) (1) ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, which causes irritation of the nose and throat, nervous system depression, headache, and vomiting; (2) ethylhexyl acrylate, a carcinogen that causes burning and irritation of the nose and throat, as well as shortness of breath and coughing; (3) isobutylene, which causes dizziness and drowsiness.

Governor Mike DeWine (R) ordered all residents within a one-mile radius to evacuate before the controlled release and burn. Three days later, the evacuation was [lifted](https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/u-s-epa-updates-on-east-palestine-train-derailment/) after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported air quality readings consistently showed readings at points below safety screening levels for contaminants of concern.

&gt;Around-the-clock testing inside and outside the evacuation zone around the village of East Palestine and a sliver of Pennsylvania showed the air had returned to normal levels that would have been seen before the derailment, [said](https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-ohio-climate-and-environment-business-evacuations-e7a9c9db57561fceb3224546c872fd58?taid=63e42c2905dea00001ee2d66&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter) James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

&gt;Hundreds and hundreds of data points weve collected over the time show the air quality is safe, he said.

###Local impacts

Despite the all-clear from authorities, residents are nervous to returnand rightfully so. Every American should remember that the lead contaminants in [Flints drinking water](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis) were detected almost immediately by residents, yet it took two years for officials to attempt to rectify the situation. During that time, authorities denied there was any threat to public health. Now, almost a decade later, virtually every official involved in the crisis has had their criminal charges [dropped](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/judge-dismisses-flint-water-crisis-charges-against-former-michigan-officials) or [dismissed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/us/flint-michigan-rick-snyder-water-crisis/index.html).

If officials are right about the overall air readings being safe to breathe, what about the air and surfaces inside residents houses? This is one [concern](https://apnews.com/article/evacuations-ohio-pennsylvania-climate-and-environment-9fc6adc154daa5b8245380b7067dc6d7) of people returning home, especially those with children:

&gt;Hours after being told she could go home for the first time since a train hauling chemicals derailed and later sent up a toxic plume near the Pennsylvania state line, Melissa Henry nervously walked inside her house.

&gt;First, she washed her sheets and pillow cases. Then she started throwing out everything left on her kitchen counters. She opened all of her windows too, hoping to air out whatever might have seeped inside while fearful of the air outside too.

&gt;Was that the right thing to do or not? You just dont know, she said Thursday. It was a nightmare, it still is.

Returning residents may also find their pets [sick or deceased](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/02/11/pzct-f11.html):

&gt;A certified foxkeeper just outside the evacuation zone has reported one of his foxes died after the burn. Out of nowhere, he just started coughing really hard, just shut down, and he had liquid diarrhea and just went very fast, Taylor Holzer told WKBN television based in Youngstown. He said all of his foxes have been sick and lethargic since the train derailment February 3. This is not a fox acts. He is very weak, limp. His eyes are very watery and weepy, Holzer said, adding that some of the foxes are pacing in their pens, a sign they are unwell.

&gt;Peoples cats are getting sick and dying, and peoples other birds that they have in their house that they werent being able to evacuate either. Its just, its not safe for them.

###Widespread impacts

Air pollution is the most obviously visible impact of the derailment and subsequent burn, but water pollution is just as dangerous. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources estimated that the release of toxic chemicals [killed](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/east-palestine-train-derailment/odnr-estimates-3-500-fish-killed-by-east-palestine-train-derailment-spill) thousands of fish across over 7 miles of streams in East Palestine. And, as we all know, water doesnt stay in one spot. The [Ohio River Basin](https://www.ohio.edu/orbcre/basin/index.html#:~:text=The%20Ohio%20River%20Basin%20is,Louisville%2C%20Indianapolis%2C%20and%20Nashville.)already [designated](https://www.wlwt.com/article/report-shows-ohio-river-leads-nation-in-toxic-pollutants/41561994) the most toxic watershed in the nation due to chemical and fossil fuel production across Appalachiastretches across 14 states and covers a region of about 204,000 square miles. While officials have touted the safe air quality levels, they have not been able to provide similar assurances for water quality:

&gt;Linda Murphy, who lives about three miles from the site of the train derailment, confirmed to News 5 last week that she saw dead fish floating in several locations on Leslie Run. She says her family isn't touching the well she uses for water on her property until they get assurances that it's safe.

&gt;Thats what we bathe in, that's what we drink, that's what we cook with and thats what I also give to my animals, so its a major concern and they could not reassure me the water was safe to drink. They didnt say it wasnt and absolutely refrained from saying that it was, Murphy said.

###Arresting reporters

Making things worse, Ohio police officers arrested a reporter broadcasting from Gov. DeWines press conference about the derailment, stoking rumors that the government is trying to somehow cover up the full extent of the disaster. NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was arrested on charges of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest after being told to keep quiet in the middle of a live report. [Body camera footage](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/10/us/newsnation-reporter-arrest-ohio-body-camera-video/index.html) shows National Guard adjutant general Maj. Gen. John Harris pushing Lambert before the reporter is placed on the ground, handcuffed, and removed from the building.

###Ignored warnings and corrupt companies

The disastrous derailment comes just weeks after the President and Congress shut down a potential national railroad strike, siding with rail companies over railway workers who warned of dangerous industry-wide [practices](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/11/ohio-train-derailment-wake-up-call). 

&gt;The Palestine wreck is the tip of the iceberg and a red flag, said [Ron Kaminkow, an Amtrak locomotive engineer and former Norfolk Southern freight engineer], who is secretary for the Railroad Workers United, a non-profit labor group that coordinates with the nations rail unions. If something is not done, then its going to get worse, and the next derailment could be cataclysmic.

The major rail companies have all drastically cut workers in recent years, part of an effort to slash costs and boost profits. Norfolk Southern, responsible for the Ohio derailment, let more than [3,500](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/railroads-are-slashing-workers-cheered-on-by-wall-street-to-stay-profitable-amid-trumps-trade-war/2020/01/02/dc757ed4-1603-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html) employees go in 2019 alone.

&gt;More than 20,000 rail workers have lost their jobs in the past year [2019], the biggest layoffs in rail since the Great Recession and a nearly 10 percent decline in rail employment, according to Labor Department data through November&The rail industry, which once employed more than a million Americans, fell below 200,000 employees in 2019, the first time that has happened since the Labor Department started keeping track of railroad employment in the 1940s&

&gt;We fundamentally changed the way we operate over the last 2½ years, said Bryan Tucker, vice president of communications at CSX. Its a different way of running a railroad.

&gt;A Norfolk Southern spokeswoman said the company was focused on increasing efficiency and profitable growth and that as our business changes, so too do our personnel needs. Union Pacific stressed the environmental benefits of moving goods by rail instead of truck.

While laying off thousands of workers, Norfolk Southern spent [billions](http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en/news/norfolk-southern-announces-new--10-billion-stock-repurchase-prog.html) on stock buybacks and [millions](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/ceo-pay-norfolk-southern-rises-842-million) on executive salary increases. 

The company simultaneously fought off both a [shareholder proposal](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2017/friendsfiduciary011717-14a8.pdf) to assess, review, and mitigate risks of hazardous material transportation and a [proposed](https://www.levernews.com/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/) federal regulation that would have tightened safety guidelines for trains carrying hazardous materials. 

&gt;The sequence of events began a decade ago in the wake of a major uptick in derailments of trains carrying crude oil and hazardous chemicals, including a New Jersey train crash that leaked the same toxic chemical as in Ohio.

&gt;In response, the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials. However, after industry pressure, the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials, including the chemical involved in this weekends disaster.

&gt;Then came 2017: After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns, the Trump administration  backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans  rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nations rails.

Rail company and chemical company lobbyists aggressively pushed back on safety regulations that could have potentially prevented the Norfolk Southern train from derailing in Ohio. Preliminary information, including video evidence, [suggests](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2023/02/10/east-palestine-train-derailment-video-fire-axle-alert/stories/202302100070) that the train traveled at least 20 miles with a malfunctioning axle. Shortly before the accident, the train crew had gotten an alert to the issue and started to apply the brakes, however, it can take over a mile for a train of that length to fully stop&unless it has Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes.

Heres where the corruption and malfeasance enters the picture: Norfolk Southern and other rail companies successfully [lobbied](https://www.levernews.com/rail-companies-blocked-safety-rules-before-ohio-derailment/) against requiring ECP brakes on all trains, even those carrying hazardous chemicals:

&gt;Then came 2017: After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns, the Trump administration  backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans  rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nations rails.

&gt;Specifically, regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. Norfolk Southern had previously touted the new technology  known as Electronically Controlled Pneumatic (ECP) brakes  for its potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60 percent over conventional air brake systems.

&gt;But the companys lobby group nonetheless pressed for the rules repeal, telling regulators that it would impose tremendous costs without providing offsetting safety benefits. [...]

&gt;Would ECP brakes have reduced the severity of this accident? Yes, Steven Ditmeyer, a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), told The Lever.

###Political donations

Finally, lets look at why railroad companies have been allowed to get away with a consistent pattern of over [1,700](https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/nationworld/how-often-do-trains-derail-more-often-than-you-think/#:~:text=While%20fatalities%20from%20train%20derailments,of%201%2C704%20derailments%20per%20year.) train derailments per year. The answer is political money. In 2022 alone, Norfolk Southern made [$1,332,689](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/norfolk-southern/summary?toprecipcycle=2022&amp;contribcycle=2022&amp;lobcycle=2022&amp;outspendcycle=2022&amp;id=D000019639&amp;topnumcycle=2022) in contributions and spent $1.8 billion in lobbying lawmakers and regulators. The entire rail industry donated [$3.7 million](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/freight-rail-pacs-contribute-to-republicans-and-democrats) to politicians in 2020, the majority going to Republican candidates.

*In contrast, Norfolk Southern (worth $55 billion) is [giving](https://www.yahoo.com/now/norfolk-southern-giving-25-000-200000640.html) East Palestine just $25,000 to clean up the town they polluted.*

The political money isnt likely to slow down, as rail companies seek to expand their network. Days after the Ohio derailment, Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern proposed a $27 billion merger that would increase the transport of hazardous material like fossil fuels across America. According to an environmental impact [statement](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/13/canadian-pacific-kansas-city-southern-merger-tar-sands-texas), a total of nearly 13 releases of hazardous materials could occur every year along any point of the rail line.

&gt;If it goes through, it would create the first direct route from Canadas bitumen oil sands mines in Alberta to heavy crude refineries in Port Arthur, an industrial city on the Texas coast. We fully expect that the combination of the two railroads will only strengthen their support for this new source of bitumen, the vice-president of USD Group, a Texas-based midstream company, told a Canadian newspaper last year.

&gt;Local environmentalists say the increase in fossil fuel refining along the Gulf coast will impact their health  and increase carbon emissions. It also could put residents like Williams at risk of a hazardous oil spill. I live close enough to the track that if there is a derailment, and there is hazardous materials, its going to impact me directly, she said. Not to mention all of the hundreds of other residents that these lines are on  its pretty alarming.","Keep_Track",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/112az2x/rail_companies_fought_against_safety_measures/"

MI state

I'm a new single mom. My partner of 15 years cheated and walked out on me and our 12 year old son. He left me with $1500 in bills a month. I work extremely hard as a server to cover everything he left me with. I files for child support in October, signed paperwork in January but the courts are so slow he hasn't even been served yet.
In the meantime while I wait, he refuses to help out or pay a single cent. His name is still on the lease to the apartment he left me with. 
I've asked him repeatedly to pay his portion of the lease, and I've asked repeatedly for him to help pay for a babysitter for our son while I work, and I've asked repeatedly for him to pick up our son while i work. He refuses all.
I can't afford a sitter. I'm paying out more than I make and I'm losing money. 

I'm in the state of Michigan, and as far as I can tell the law says a 10 year old can stay home alone. This weekend he called the police on me for leaving our 12 year old home and threatened to call CPS. But yet, he won't help with anything. The police didn't call me, or make contact with me. I went this morning and everything seemed to be in the clear. Then I called CPS and they said 13 was the age to leave him alone.
I'm confused on what is right here.

My 12 year old has a cell phone, we've had extensive conversations about safe neighbors to go to. I've been teaching him since summer to stay home by himself (father had no issue with this until this weekend and even bought him the cell phone for this purpose), I call my neighbors and let them know he's alone. One neighbor calls my 12 year old and asks him if he's all right and to come to the window and wave. The other neighbor goes upstairs to check on him while I'm gone and he's welcome to go to their apartment at any time. I leave him with food, peanut butter and jelly, lunchables, he has water, juice and snacks. And I call every half hour to check on him and I only work about 4 hours or so.

I've taken every safety precaution I can come up with. This is not ideal and I'd rather not leave him home alone, but I feel stuck in this position. Everything is in order and seems to be fine except for the operator on the CPS line telling me the age is 13 not 12. 
I want to do what's best for him but I need to keep a roof over his head with a rent I can't afford.

The location of the shot was chosen to reduce risk to people on the ground and improve chances for recovery. NORAD detected the object Sunday morning and said based on its flight path and data they can reasonably connect this object to the radar signal picked up over Montana, which flew in proximity to sensitive DOD sites. They did not consider it a military threat to anything on the ground, but a safety hazard to civilian aircraft and threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities.

# UFO Shot Down Over Canada on Saturday

NORAD detected a UFO over Alaska late on Friday. U.S. fighter jets monitored it as it crossed over into Canadian airspace where they were joined by Canadian aircraft. The object was aloft at 40,000 feet and said to pose a risk to civilian aircraft. A U.S. F-22 then shot down the object in Canadian territory on Saturday at 3:41 EST. Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand declined to speculate about the origin of the object, which she said was cylindrical in shape.

# UFO Shot Down Over Alaska on Friday

The White House said a 'high-altitude object' has been shot down over Alaska on Friday. The President ordered the shootdown, but the origin of the object it yet to be determined. The order was made as it posed a thread to the safety of civilian flights, out of an abundance of caution, and the recommendation of the Pentagon. The object was first surveilled by fighter jets Thursday night and then again this morning.

Current details:

* Detected by ground radar and shot down at 1:45PM EST
* Unmanned object size of a small car flying around 40,000 feet.
* ""All I say is that it wasn't 'flying' with any sort of propulsion, so if that is 'balloon-like' well -- we just don't have enough at this point.""
* Described as ""cylindrical and silver-ish gray"" and seemed to be floating.
* Recovery effort will be made and are moving towards the site, but no current timeline.

He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.

Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.

This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.

He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.

EDIT: My dad and I know the NRA is not directly responsible for mass shootings but their consistent deflect of any criticism pertaining to mass shootings and gun violence is why he decided to end his membership.","offmychest",112,"https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/112cj74/my_father_called_me_and_said_hes_ending_his_nra/"

I didn't see it, but it must have been an insane game. We all know how sad and inept the Hawkeyes were on offense this past season, and it seems their basketball team is an exact opposite. 112 is a very high total for basketball, and I was wondering if they outscored the football team's offense.

So let see who scored more. Iowa offense (football) the entire season, or Iowa offense (basketball) in this single game.

Keep in mind that a large part of Iowa's success last year came from defense and special teams. I am considering field goals and extra points as special teams points. The target is Iowa basketball's total today, **112**

Game 1, South Dakota State: 0 points on offense. They won from a field goal and two safeties.

Game 2, Iowa State: 6 points on offense. One touchdown.

Game 3, Nevada: 18 points on offense. Three touchdowns.

Game 4, Rutgers: 6 points on offense. One touchdown, but the defense scored twice

Game 5, Michigan: 12 points on offense. Seriously, Michigan, how did they score against you?

Game 6, Illinois: 0 points on offense in a game that featured only field goals

Game 7, Ohio State: 0 points on offense, but they got a neat scoop and score

Game 8, Northwestern: 18 points on offense. Unfortunately NU was so bad last year they let Iowa explode like a volcano against them for three touchdowns.

Game 9, Purdue: 18 points on offense. At think at this point in the season Brian Ferentz figured some things out.

Game 10, Wisconsin: 12 points on offense. The two touchdowns were accompanied by an interception return for a TD

Game 11, Minnesota: 6 points on offense

Game 12, Nebraska: 12 points on offense

Bowl Game, Kentucky: 6 points on offense, and their defense helped the offense with two scores of their own, without allowing Kentucky to score at all!

I was hoping this would be a funny Reddit post but unfortunately it seems that I have wasted my time, as Iowa's offense scored **114** points worth of touchdowns in 2022, and did manage to outscore the basketball team's performance today by 2 points. However, if you selectively change the statistical qualifier to say *regular season,* then Iowa's basketball team *did* outscore their football team's season-long offensive output today.","CFB",67,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/11c3s71/the_iowa_hawkeyes_mens_basketball_team_scored/"

New Mexico (19-7, 6-7) was without the services of senior Jaelen House (17.3 point per game, four rebounds, 4.6 assists) for the second straight game, and it showed. Struggling to get anything going against Wyoming (8-17, 3-10). The Lobos were down seven at the break, and were outscored by the same amount in the second half, losing 70 to 56. The win by the Cowboys was by far their best of the year. Adding to the victory was that it happened at The Pit, a court that is historically difficult to pick up road victories on. Hunter Maldonado recorded his third double-double of the year, scoring 20 and adding 10 rebounds. He also had five assists. Jamal Mashburn Jr finished with 15 points on 6 of 17 shooting for NMU, a team high.

New Mexico is starting to get precariously close to falling off the bubble according to the We Have Fans Too prediction model that I just made up off the top of my head and is not a real thing. They have now lost four straight. The first two are more forgivable in the eyes of the selection committee, coming against Utah State (away) and Nevada (home), but the last two are a lot harder to look past. They came against the 155th NET ranked Air Force and Wyoming, who entered last night's contest at the 197th ranked team in the country, NET wise. Additionally, the loss sends NMUs Mountain West Conference record to 6 and 7. In most cases, failing to finish above .500 in your own conference doesnt bode well for your at-large chances.

Even with House out, New Mexico was favored to beat Wyoming by 10.5 last night and 6 against Air Force. While the committee may consider what a healthy House (assuming he IS healthy) does for a NMU team versus what it does to their team when hes out, those are bad losses. Especially last night.

The question with New Mexico will be if the committee will consider the hamstring injury to Jalen House that has kept him on the bench the last two games? Its been said in the past that injuries have more of an impact on the seeding of teams that have already made it than the actual selection of teams. If thats the case, then New Mexico is starting to be in big trouble. Lobos fans can take some solace in the fact that Bart Torviks New Mexico team sheet still has them as an 11th seed after his website updated this morning. Hes been doing this a lot longer than me, so I'll defer to him in most cases, but I personally cant help but feel New Mexico is in trouble. 

**Top Four Teams in MAC Win, Four Teams Remain Within One Game of First**

Kent State (21-5, 11-2) will remain in first place atop the MAC for at least another game, following their 82 to 58 road victory over Western Michigan (6-20, 2-11). VonCameron David, averaging 7.2 points per game this season, finished with a game high 21 for the Golden Flashes.

Kent States next opponent, Eastern Michigan (6-20, 3-10) fell to Akron (18-8, 10-3) by the final score of 78 to 51. The win keeps Akron in a tie for second, just one game back Enrique Freeman was red hot, scoring 22 points on 9 of 11 shooting. He also collected 15 rebounds. His 11.2 rebounds on the season puts the junior at 6th in the nation.

Toledo (20-6, 11-2) remains in a virtual tie for first in the conference, getting by Miami (OH) 89 to 71. All five Rockets starters scored in double-digits, led by Setric Millner Jrs 19 points. Toledo has now won 10 straight, the second longest winning streak in the country.

Ball State (19-7, 10-3) defended their home court, defeating Northern Illinois (11-15, 7-6) 87 to 77. Nine of the 10 starters in this game scored in double-digits. Two players on Ball State had double-doubles. 

Payton Sparks scored 20 points and pulled down 16 rebounds while Cardinals teammate Mickey Pearson Jr added 10 and 11.

In another notable result, the Silukies of Southern Illinois (20-8, 12-5) move to just a half a game behind Drake and Bradley for top spot in the Missouri Valley Conference, with a hard fought 66 to 62 road victory over Valparaiso (11-17, 5-12). The rest of the MVC plays tonight.

**Todays Notable Games**

Very solid slate today. We will start with a look at the MVC, since we just ended with the MVC. Top team Drake (21-6, 12-4) will look for their 8th straight victory when they host Northern Iowa (12-14, 8-8). UNI has lost five straight.

MVC co-leader Bradley (19-8, 14-12) will stay at home to take on Missouri State (14-12, 10-6). Missouri State has just sort of hung around all conference season, and a win here could move them to just one game back of first place.

Looking to take over top spot in case of a slip up of Bradley or Drake are Belmont (18-9, 11-5) and Indiana State (18-9, 11-5). Belmont hosts Evansville (5-22, 1-15) while Indiana State would win their 6th in a row if they can escape Illinois and UIC (10-17, 2-14). Six teams are within two games of first with four to play.

Navy (15-11, 8-6) would move into second place with a victory over Lehigh (14-11, 9-5). Theyll have to do it on the road, but they enter with a four game winning streak. Colgate (19-8, 13-1) wins the conference with a win tonight over Army (14-13, 8-6).

With five games left to play, Vermont (15-10, 9-2) has taken a two game lead in the America East conference. They look to at least keep that same spread with a victory over New Hampshire (11-12, 6-5). Vermont is one of the hottest teams in all of mid-major basketball, winning seven in a row.

UMass Lowell (20-7, 7-5) and Bryant (16-9, 7-5) meet in a AE battle of two teams 2.5 games back. 

Binghamton (11-13, 7-4) would move to just one game back if Vermont loses and they get by NJIT (7-17, 4-7). 

UC Santa Barbara (20-4, 11-2) will be without the services of their big man Andre Kelly due to suspension when they host UC Irvine (17-8, 10-3). Thats huge, because a UC Irvine win would move them to a tie for first place in the Big West with UCSB.

2023-03-06,1678076138,"5 takeaways from Purdue vs Illnois","26-5 in the regular season. Very good. 5 takeaways

1. Brandon Newman is building momentum for himself at the right time. He had his best performance of the season against The Illinois Fighting Illni scoring 19 points, 5 assits, and 6 rebounds. From hitting big time shots to close out the first half to making a difference on defense all game long, Brandon was everywhere the Boilermakers needed him to be in this game. If you're Matt Painter, you can definetly feel confident in giving Newman starter minutes in the post season. Right now this young man really wants it all and you can tell by how he has been playing the last few games with confidence. Plenty of ups and downs this season from Brandon, but he's had more ups than downs these last 2 games. Right now, Confident and competitive Brandon Newman is in the Locker Room for the Boilermakers as the tournaments draw nearer, Let's hope this version of Newman is here to stay. When Newman is playing with confidence, the Boilermakers are a more confident and calm team.
2. Braden Smith played well in this game and made a difference in both halves for the Boilermakers. In 31 minutes of play time, He had 15 points, 1 rebound and 3 assits in the Boilermakers close victory over Illinois. Braden was very strong in getting the ball to where it needed to go aside from a few mistakes and turnovers. He also shot well from the free throw line. When The Illini brought press, he handled that well and set the right pace for each situation. This game was a tale of two halves for the Boilermakers and Braden Smith played a huge role in keeping the team on course in both halves and his decision making was key in Purdue's most crucial baskets on the game. Being a Point gaurd comes with many responsabilites. Braden Smith does a wonderful job embracing his role on the team. The Boilermakers will ask alot of this freshman point gaurd in the ncaa tournment, and it's a big ask, but the team will have a great opportunity to wins games in the tournament if Braden Smith can contiue to handle these pg responsibilites to the best of his ability.
3. Based on observation, this game was a bit of a struggle for Zach Edey. Illinois was well locked in on Edey on defense. They defended him well and yes they got away with quite a bit in terms of hacking, some pushing, and any conact and/or anything else that could have been called a foul. (mainly in the second half) Now with all that said, Zach had some struggles with a few things such as ball security, some bad passes, and a few other things. In spite of these things, Zach Edey still put up 17 points. Edey was no where close to being bad in this game, infact he was good, perhaps Zach would probalby tell all of us this wasn't his best performance by his standards. If anything in this game, he had his hands full of struggles more than usual. I have no doubt he will be stronger next contest and more ready to go in the B1G tournment. His focus, toughness, stamina, detirmination, and poise are always there. And even with the problems Zach faced, others stepped up to help him. Trey Kaufman Renn showed strength when Edey needed a break and TKR held down the paint area well on both sides. Shoot he even made a 3. It was like he was back to playing power forward. Today may not have been Zach's best day, but still he's Purdue's go to guy in March.
4. As mentioned before, this game was a tale of two halves. The first half was all Purdue scoring 47 points en route to one of their biggest leads at the half on the season. That first half was the best first half Purdue had played since earlier this season. Of course you don't win games in the first half, you win them in the second half. And the Boilermakers came so damn close to losing this game in the final 10 minutes. The Boilermakers had plenty of missed shots, layups, and misfires on defense in the second. And The fighting Illni turned up the heat on the Boilermakers in the second half and came close to taking the lead and stealing victory away from Purdue basketball. It was all Illinois in the second, they just fell short thanks to good free throw shooting and defense in the final 2 minutes by Purdue. The Boilermakers need to be better at matching the intensity of opposing teams they will face in both the B1G and NCAA tournament. And as said before, HAVE TO PLAY THE FULL 40 MINUTES. Don't coast, play your hardest to the final whistle. Plenty of things for the Boilermakers to improve on including 3 point shooting still, but matching intensity and keeping the foot on the gas for the entire game should be a huge focus in practice this week.
5. That game was certainly too close to call at the end. I figured Illinois would close the gap in the second half, but things could have gone way smoother for the Boilermakers in the second half. This game was another one of those games that could've gone either way in the second half. It for sure was starting to look like another game this season which the Boilermakers were bound to lose focus and control of or another one of those snatching defeat from the jaws of victory moments in the final minutes. Thankfully not this time. The Boilermakers did enough to win this game in the end and avoid a disaster of a loss. Illnois is a very good team and one of our biggest rivals, so it makes sense that this victory would not come easy. And to be honest, this was another one of those games that had the feel and/or caliber of an NCAA tournement game. It was intense. All of this being said, It wasn't perfect, but this is a great victory for the Purdue Boilermakers. Great way to send the Seniors out who played their final home game and a great way to celebrate Purdue Basketball's 25th B1G regular season championship. I'm 100% jealous of any Boilermaker who was at the game today and got to bask in the celebration. I truly wish I could have been there. What a scene. This victory may also help the Boilermakers capture a #1 seed in the Big Dance. Still there's a strong chance the Boilermakers will need to contiue to win out to get that #1 seed. Well that's it for the regular season. There's still bigger and greater things for this team to accomplish this season than winning the B1G. Now the madness really gets going as if it hadn't already started. Time for this team to get more ready for the madness. Practice, hard work, focus, motivation, and film study becomes all the more important this week. Next Up, The B1G tournament which for the Boilermakers may begin on friday but truly begins now. Their first game will be either against Rutgers or Michigan. More opportunites to earn Quad 1 wins, but also new challanges ahead. The Boilermakers focus will have to be one game at a time. The time to be at your very very best is now. Let's find out if this team will be at their very very best. And if you are the Purdue Boilermakers's, it's time for you to believe you can achive anything you work hard at and set your mind to. Boiler Up Hammer Down!

2023-03-07,1678147215,"The Tecumseh-American War Part III | Pine &amp; Liberty","**Second Battle of Fort Saint Anthony**

Following disastrous defeats at Fort Saint Anthony and the ensuing defeat, Calhoun removed Isaiah Stillman from any command, instead tasking him to serve as a strategist for Winfield Scott. Meanwhile, Edmund P. Gaines, who led the retreat from Tecumseh's Protectorate, was given a slap on the wrist, owing to a successful victory at Leach Lake Edmund P. Gaines only received a slap on the wrist, with him only transferred to Taylor's army. Since the Fort held critical positions along with crucial resources, a second trek into Saint Anthony was suggested various times, but insufficient interest amongst superiors, and an inability to raise a militia, ended any chance. Though out of a personal ambition to outdo his fellow generals and for the shame he faced in the defeat at Gaines' run, Edmund P. Gaines would eventually convince Scott to allow a second expedition to Fort Saint Anthony.

From the former Indiana Territory, Edmund P. Gaines would march his men north of the Mississippi River over a weeks-long period to reach Fort Saint Anthony. In late March, as his troops reached the surroundings of Fort Saint Anthony, prior to the attack, Gaines instructed troops to set up at Sturgeon Lake. The following morning, the Militia made its way to the Fort, leading a head-on attack from the east, with troops bombarding the fort, quickly killing any patrolling warriors, and eventually large portions of the camp. Unlike the previous battle at Fort Saint Anthony, the warriors that prevented the first attack were unavailable, due to Winfield Scott's and Zachary Taylor's conquests in the east.

After a day-long battle, Gaines' force, which consisted of over 1300 men, came out triumphant, after having stomped out any of the surviving Indian warriors, the General went to free any imprisoned U.S. soldiers, however, to his surprise, Gaines would find most malnourished or on the brink of death due to famine. Nonetheless, after having freed the prisoners, the General would order troops to fortify the area, as the militia would raise the American flag over the Fort. In the weeks that followed, Edmund P. Gaines ordered 80 of his men to make the trip back in order to spread the news of the siege's success.

Upon hearing word of the siege, Winfield Scott ordered further reinforcements for Fort Saint Anthony, and at the behest of prominent officials, local war hero William Trousdale was ordered to raise a militia. Once he recruited a full battalion, he was instructed to follow the path used by Gaines into the fort, however, on the way, they faced various skirmishes with the Indians of the area, which had been alerted of their presence. Yet after a rough excursion, Trousdale and his men would eventually set foot in the fort; where they'd proceed to help with its fortification. Having been followed by a military of Indian warriors, the troop faced its third blitz, on April 16th, 1841. Along with Indians, servicemen sent by the Hudson's Bay Company to reclaim the fort, attacked the Fort, however, since the Americans held a greater amount of men and superior technology, they'd be able to defend the fort from its invader after a five-day war, that ended with zero British/British-Canadian dead, though hundreds of warriors were killed in action.

After failing to reclaim the fort, the Hudson's Bay Company enlisted the aid of the United Kingdom, however with the crown occupied with the Second Egyptian-Ottoman War and Opium War, attempts would prove futile.

**Battle of** **Kalamazoo**

Zachary Taylor's retreat at the Battle of Rasin River effectively ended any plans Winfield Scott had envisioned for an invasion of the Protectorate's north, however, years later into the invasion, Calhoun had ordered troops be sent to advance into the north so that Ohio would be protected in case of an attempted invasion. Both Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines volunteered to lead the charge, yet, since both were politically critical of his administration, John C. Calhoun refused their offers, instead employing Winfield Scott to take command. An army was provided to Taylor, and in March 1840, Taylor was sent to Greenville, Ohio, and was ordered to train troops to lead an eventual attack months later. In May, Calhoun directed him to deploy troops north and into the St. Joseph River.

Taylor's men trekked past Ohio and into the former Michigan territory for four days. As Taylor approached the St. Joseph River Indian Camp, he and his top advisors plotted a strategy, agreeing to attack the fort from both entrances, and he tasked John E. Wool with leading the charge from the south. For the night, Taylor set up camp in the dense forest, a few hundred meters away from the Indian fort, and though he was sure, the woods concealed the troops' location, warriors that knew of their arrival, attacked the troops hours later, at the dawn of the following day. A brief skirmish occurred, between Taylor's army and a band of about 100 Indian warriors, the warriors were easily dealt with, leaving several dead and even more injured from the initial skirmish, after hours of fighting, Indians would retreat, Taylor ordered soldiers to follow the retreating warriors, yet the dense forest would prove to make the chase ineffective.

After having no luck in flagging down their attackers, the soldiers returned from their pursuit defeated, yet with the larger ramifications of their camp's location exposed, Taylor would hurry to an early attack on the settlement of the St. Joseph River on the afternoon of March 25th, 1840. After a barrage of bullets was fired on nearby warriors, the army broke ranks to swarm the Indian fortifications, surprising the camp's warriors. For the next two days, the American infantry's forces advanced without a halt until capturing the entire base, in an overwhelming victory, Taylor's men were able to capture 250 men, while several hundred more were dead. Although a plethora was either captured or killed, surviving warriors led by chief Kennekuk fled to the north through the area's dense forests.

Taylor ordered a section of troops to stay behind after securing the fort, while Zachary Taylor along with the majority of his forces left in pursuit of the Indians, and into where they were last seen, heading north up to the Kalamazoo River. Deploying the use of bloodhounds to track the fleeing Indian scent, Taylor would follow the warriors' tails for days, until catching the warriors in the forests surrounding the Kalamazoo river.

Taylor ordered troops to slowly advance so that they'd be able to catch the Indians off guard, but the order would soon be given to charge. Unlike their previous encounters, the Indians chose not to flee and instead fought hand-to-hand, at the same time, Taylor instructed James Shields to lead a division of the army. For several hours, Taylor's men battled the Indians in the forest, and despite a vast arsenal of manpower, the warriors' knowledge of the terrain left U.S. troops at a disadvantage, as they chose to exploit the ticket in order to gain an advantage against the army. Nonetheless, the Indians entered the battle with a mere 300 men compared to Taylor's 1,700, thus, after hours of fighting, Taylor would come out triumphant against the Indians' defense, forcing them into a retreat deeper into the forest, and though Taylor was eager to follow their second retreat, the difficult terrain, dense woods, and dwindling supplies left him unable too; and reaching halfway into May, Taylor would order a retreat from the Kalamazoo river; and a return back to the St. Joseph River fort.

**Worth's Expedition**

In September 1841, Winfield Scott drafted a plan to effectively end the war through the siege of the Wabash River, and though Scott had considered more prominent generals, personally advocating for the recently redeemed war general Edmund P. Gaines, Calhoun's suggestion led Scott to choose William J. Worth. The two generals met up in Fort Harrison to discuss Scott's war plan, and he instructed Worth to follow the Wabash River north, meanwhile with Scott's enthusiasm to lead an attack from the east, the Major General elected to deal with the lion's share of the potential battles; It was ordered that the two armies would meet up at Fort Wayne, which Scott had expected to capture.

[ William J. Worth, the general who led the expedition up the Wabash River ](https://preview.redd.it/z6fg9lxej7ma1.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5e858f9620e4226f25c1bd26cd794ad57549d404)

After days, Worth and his army reached the abdomen of the Wabash River, and from there, traveled upstream. At Scott's behest, William J. Worth was cautioned to avoid any unnecessary attacks on Indian camps or settlements, out of concerns that it could reveal the army's location and jeopardize Winfield Scott's grand scheme; Scott, as per the purpose of the division in the first place, had ordered that Worth attack pivotal camps, to burn resources, crops, and supplies, in order to force their hand into a treaty.

While en route upstream the Wabash River, brigadier John Coffee Hays spotted an Indian settlement, and even though the army had encountered a plethora up to this point, its magnitude led Worth to order soldiers to head down the sugar creek to further investigate. Reports Worth received of its alleged significance led the general to instruct the army to approach the camp, and while crossing the river, Worth had only managed to get a few regulars and volunteers across, before the Indians began an unexpected and severe pounce. On both sides of the river, U.S. troops hastily rushed to organize themselves, amid the crossfire soldiers, slowly crossed to aid the army.

Despite rising American casualties, he left them with orders to cross the river as rapidly as they could, with Worth's reorganization proving successful, the army was able to back the Indians out of the forest and into the neighboring camp. Worth decided against the pursuit of the retreating warriors, instead opting to fall back out of Sugar Creek to follow the original trail. For hours, his troops marched back onto the original river, and followed it as upstream as possible, until choosing to set up camp. At dusk on the same day, the same Indians attacked American troops, apparently stalking the army since its a retreat from Sugar Creek. A combination of the thick woods surrounding the base and the pitch-dark environment left American soldiers unable to detect the attacking Indians, so as the first shots rang out, patrolling troops were clueless. For hours, warriors swarmed the camp, yet with the greater number of American men and manpower, they were able to press forward until warriors stopped arriving from the woods, and the enduring ones either were killed or fled.

After previously being caught off guard, Worth's army remained alert, wary of another wave of attackers, with it being decided the Americans would leave first thing in the morning. For days, troops continued an uneventful march north, daring not to attack another tribe after their embarrassment at Sugar Creek, yet with a sudden attack on a voyage along the Eel River, the American army would find itself forcibly wrapped into yet another conflict. After marching miles and diverting from the Wabash River to follow the Eel River, a shortcut to access Fort Wayne, they came under fire from a band of Indian warriors. Worth ordered troops to charge, however, the warriors would fall back into the dense woodland where they had set up a camp and took a determined stand. In the battle, which lasted mere hours, army captains Samuel Hamilton Walker and Joseph E. Johnston were both fatally wounded, however less fortunate for Johnston, an infection set in, resulting in a premature death days later. Military officials had suggested a retreat away from the conflict, however, with General William Worth concerned about knowledge of their presence spreading, he instructed troops to swiftly track down the warriors in question, to either capture or kill them.

Bloodhounds were sent to the region where the shots were last heard and within hours, the hounds had successfully located the group of warriors, subsequently, General William J. Worth, and a division of 800 men, approached the Indian encampment from the east. In the evening, Worth's scouts detected warriors patrolling the area, which had started it all, Worth's dragoons and infantry attacked, killing several amid the initial chaos, and a few others in the subsequent retreat. The Indian warriors fell back deeper into Forrest to reorganize, taking up a second position, and though Worth attempted to head the charge, the uncertainty of it led him to place colonel Timothy Andrews at the mantle of the hunt, therefore, Worth could proceed to Fort Wayne.

Colonel Andrews led 20 dragoons across the forest to the west of the Seminoles and flanked their position, causing them to scatter in a retreat, all the while, soldiers shot at them, killing a majority, however, Andrews would let the surviving flee, choosing not to chase them deeper into the forest. A day later, Andrews and the division would reconvene with William J. Worth, and join him in his march towards Fort Clark.

As instructed by his superior, Winfield Scott, William J. Worth was to attack the crucial Fort Clark; a former American fort that had since then been used to defend the village surrounding it and for the storage of ammunition. Worth had soldiers investigate the area, and within hours, his army led an invasion of the settlement. Worth's army faced heavy resistance, as several warriors were deployed there, nonetheless in a monotonous battle that raged on for three days straight, Americans eventually prevailed. While in the village, houses were ransacked of any valuables, resources were stolen and fields and crops were burnt, much to the protest of the natives. However, as Worth's men approached Fort Clark itself, they found it practically abandoned, and they were able to capture it without any resistance; In the aftermath, they stole several guns and a little over a hundred muskets.

After their departure, having succeeded in stealing ammunition and weapons, and in burning valuable resources, they made their way to Fort Wayne, which it was presumed Winfield Scott had conquered. On November 18th, Worth and his men arrived in Fort Wayne, however as a result of the conflicts at Eel River and at Sugar Creek, his army arrived later than expected, nonetheless, upon their arrival, they'd find an American flag raised above the garrison, signaling that Winfield Scott's siege was a success.

**Siege of Fort Wayne**

After spending weeks trudging from Fort Harrison, Scott arrived at Defiance, a settlement named after the War of 1812 and the New England Revolutionary base of Fort Defiance, which was also one of the last settlements to be conquered in the American siege of Ohio. Upon his arrival, Scott was greeted by the remainder of his army, and after relaying his strategy to a crowd of over 5000 men, they embarked on their invasion, following the Maumee River's stream west. While already miles onto the trail, Major General Winfield Scott surveyed the area and instructed his armies to spread out into three individual divisions, led by John A. Quitman, Bennet C. Riley, and himself respectively; and ordered the divisions to destroy the nearby Indian crops and villages, so that warriors the army could cripple the natives' fighting chance at Fort Wayne, since without the reinforcements of tribes and villages, Scott had expected his army could easily overwhelm them.

Through the depths of the woodlands, Scott and his army of 2400 approached the Grover ditch, where an Indian tribe, of what his officials estimated to be, was around 650, in the afternoon, soldiers cautiously waited until a band of warriors were out of the camp's distance, before taking aim and firing at them. From their position in the woods, the army advanced into the camp, swarming the inside, burning the fields and crops, all the while, soldiers and warriors fiercely fought it out. Yet the army's overwhelming advantage led the Indians to surrender hours later, with their village in total ruins, as both houses and fields had either been severely wrecked or entirely burnt.

Meanwhile, Riley and Quitman agreed to collaborate on a co-attack on a Sioux tribe located in the far west, with their collected manpower of 2600 men, the divisions quickly traversed along the Maumee River, while Scott was distracted with his own attack on Grover Ditch. After two days, the twin divisions made it to the camp, however, to their disappointment, it was only a minor Sioux base, nonetheless, Riley and Quitman ordered their respective divisions to rush at it without any hesitancy. The warriors present at the camp rushed at soldiers, managing to scalp one, while their gunshots were able to kill or injure several others, regardless, the battle lasted only a total of two hours before they sued for peace, and like Scott's pillage, the encampment, had significant damage, in addition to most crops and valuables destroyed or ransacked.

By the time Scott finished his crusade at Grover Ditch, the twin divisions had already returned to where the army had sent camp, and after his return, the campaign to Fort Wayne resumed. On the morning of October 12th, as Scott and his army approached the territory, he laid down his plan, which involved a head-on attack on the Fort, to prevent any possibilities, that the army could raise suspicion, similarly, Scott had mentioned that by not setting a camp near Fort Wayne, it would guarantee a surprise attack, hence not giving the warriors any time to organize their attack. At noon, Winfield Scott bombarded Fort Wayne through the Maumee River, while Bennet C. Riley's division would head an attack from the eastern side of the St. Mary's River. After the initial disarray, from Scott's sudden attack, the Indian warriors began to fortify to block a potential American entrance, however, with the canon the army acquired from Defiance, lieutenant colonel Braxton Bragg was able to land his shot on the garrison's wall, demolishing a significant enough portion, and given enough leeway so that Riley's army could squeeze through, to swarm its interior.

Upon entering the fort, the attention of the warriors would turn to Riley's army, as the Indians did their best to kill any that entered through the crater hole, however, with numbers stretched between fending off the main entrance and gap, the Americans were successful in breaking through, despite the warriors' best of efforts. With the Indian wall of defense around Fort Wayne's entrance broken, Scott's army, with the aid of Riley, was fortunate to draw enough attention away to break the Warriors' line of defense, resulting in Scott's rush into the Fort, yet the ruckus of marching army, brought the attention back to Scott's army, as the warriors hastily organized, to ward off their invaders. For hours, the Indians were able to hold back Scott's entry, but with Riley's success in ending their own blockade, warrior numbers had been stretched too thin, and Scott's army was able to break through by dusk.

The crossfire continued, from the early afternoon of October 19th, until the early midnight of the following day, until it eventually ceased, as Sauk chief Towaunonne ordered the retreat of his warriors, which had a stake as the majority of the fighting force, resulting, in the chiefs of the other tribes gradually instructing their own retreats. In the aftermath of the retreat, U.S. soldiers at first believed it to be a ploy for an attempt to reorganize, however, after hours, and with no warriors in sight, Scott let his guard down enough to command troops to refortify and raid the Fort.

At dawn, at approximately 7:00 AM, the Indians launched a counter-invasion of Fort Wayne, however, instead of just the little over a thousand Indians stationed at and around Fort Wayne, in the first battle, the Indians marched back to Fort Wayne with an army amassed of the neighboring tribes and villages, the original army, and the Sauk Tribe, and arrived with a lust for vengeance and ambition to drive out their invaders. The Indians pushed through its entrance like the Americans had done before, however, unfortunately for armies of Indians, the bulk of Americans were still awake patrolling the fort, and upon the natives' approach of the encampment, soldiers began to fire. The warriors scrambled to avoid the rain of bullets all the while as they attempted to barge through Fort Wayne's doors. Within two hours, the tribesmen were able to break through the Fort's entrance, however since Americans enjoyed an advantage in both numbers and in technology, they were able to withstand the invasion, ensuring the warriors weren't able to advance too far into the Fort. The attempted siege lasted a total of two days, but as warrior numbers dwindled, U.S. troops were either able to kill or run out enough Indians that they were able to close off the entrance.

Over the next day, things fell silent as the attempted siege retreated, and for the next three days, it'd remain like this, as Scott and his men tried their best to repair any damage that occurred from the skirmish. On the 23rd, the Indians began a second attempt to invade, however, after a previous failed attempt, Sauk chief Checokalako rose to take the mantle of the attack and instructed the tribesmen to use their resources to break through the wooden walls, however, the racket of attack, alerted the U.S. soldiers located near the warriors' point of target, eventually leading said soldiers to notify the rest of the Americans at the camp.

By then, the warriors had already broken in and begun an attack on any soldiers around, meanwhile, from east of the St. Mary river, fellow Sioux Chief Towaunonne, who led an attack seeking to use the U.S. army's confusion to his advantage by marching his troops around the Fort to its entrance. Though American soldiers would at first be shell-shocked by the altercation with Checokalako, the infantry quickly snapped out of its trance when the sound of hundreds of Sioux barging into the Fort was heard. Though the hundred of Americans guarding the entrance did their best to contain the Indians, the Indians who numbered in the hundreds more were able to trample past the American defense. However, they'd only be fortunate enough to reach a few dozen yards into the fort before Scott and officials alike ordered the army to rush to the entrance. With the arrival of the soldiers, the armies of Tecumseh's Protectorate and the United States were now evenly matched in numbers, thus, the battle came down to technology, and since, the Indians' outdated and second-hand weapons, lent from Britain, stood no chance to the advanced technology and infantry of the United States Army, the Americans were able to corner the surviving warriors out of the camp; However, the soldiers made sure to leave as little survivors as possible, to prevent any other skirmishes on Fort Wayne.

Meanwhile, Checokalako and his men had by then smashed into the fort, however, despite an attempted attack, the narrow entrance caved in with their weapons, leading U.S. soldiers alerted by the noise of the racket to quickly deal with their attempted attack. But not so swayed by defeat, Checokalako, used a fire started by his warriors to ignite a shoddily-made torch on fire, to attempt to set Fort Wayne on fire, to force a direct battle on the Americans. At this point, the warriors of Towaunonne had been ousted, and though the Americans had still been alert, they expected the entire Tecumseh army had already retreated, so once Winfield Scott, ordered troops to investigate, after seeing the smoke and flames, troops were surprised to see most of the northern wall charred. Fortunately, the area's humidity prevented it from encapsulating the entire fort.

Angered by the attempted arson and the repeated skirmishes at Fort Wayne, Major General Winfield Scott would instruct troops to burn their settlements until each tribe's chiefs would agree to surrender; meanwhile, Scott, along with a share of the army, would stay put at Fort Wayne, to ensure the Indians couldn't possibly siege pivotal garrison.

Over the next two weeks, his divisions spread across the area, burning down village homes, fields, and crops, and though the villages tried their best to put up a fight, the number of warriors had been severely diminished, and unlike the united armies at Fort Wayne, the individual tribes hadn't stood a chance. However, out of all the warriors, Checokalako had the biggest target on his head, over his reported involvement in the attempted burning of Fort Wayne, Scott tasked Bennet C. Riley to head his capture, and after seeing his men flee toward the St. Joseph River days ago, Riley thought of it as a safe bet to follow that direction.

Deploying the army's bloodhounds, Riley was able to detect Checokalako's presence, and after hours, his army approached what they suspected to be the chief's village. On the dawn of November 2, 1840, Riley arrived at Checokalako's supposed tribe, hunting around, for whatever might've been his hut. Yet, before they were able to locate him, the Sauk warriors were awoken from the army's marches. From their huts, the warriors arrived prepared and ready to shoot at their invaders, and with the initial shots, the army was caught off guard, and despite only intending to peacefully capture Checokalako, plans quickly changed into burning fields and crops after it became evident that it wouldn't happen without a fight. Throughout dawn and into the late evening of the day, the battle raged on, however, the combination of diminishing morale and men, along with a wish to preserve as many fields and huts as possible, led Checokalako to turn himself in.

Arriving later than his fellow divisions, Riley returned on the 4th of November with Checokalako in hand, and after much debate, where ranking officials on both sides argued whether to execute or either imprison the Sauk Chief, yet, it'd finally be agreed upon, to detain him, in Fort Wayne's make-shift jail, until further notice. In the weeks following the pillage of the nearby Indian settlements and Checokalako's capture, the American army refocused itself on refortifying and enhancing Fort Wayne, including the restoration of the garrison's wall to erase any trace of the walls' burn damages.

RULES:

1.	I will use the current official nicknames.

2.	Explanations of nicknames will come from Wikipedia.

#FIRST ROUND:

*Quinnipiac Bobcats vs Penn State Nittany Lions*

Bobcats: Its a wild cat found in North America. They are predators and prefer rabbits. They can kill birds up to the size of swans. Also, they are territorial and mainly solitary.

Nittany Lions: Its an eastern mountain lion that used to reside at Nittany Mountain nearby the campus of Penn State. Sadly, they havent been seen at Nittany Mountain since the 1880s.

Winner: Bobcat as there are currently no reported eastern mountain lions at Nittany Mountain.


*Wisconsin Badgers vs Long Island University Sharks*

Badgers: Wiki doesnt specify the type of badger, but Ill assume Wisconsin is referring to the American Badger. So, they are carnivores and have few natural predators. They are known for digging tunnels and are generally nocturnal. They are mostly located in the prairies where its easier to dig.

Sharks: They are carnivorous fish that are also apex predators. They are found in salt-water all over the world. Some species do have the ability to live in fresh water. Sharks with sharp and needle-like teeth tend to crush and eat mollusks, crustaceans, and mammals. Other sharks have small teeth as they only eat plankton. Some species also can use camouflage to blend into the environment to make it easier to eat their prey. Shark tails are used to maneuver and increase speed in the water.

Winner: Shark. The badger stays in its tunnel knowing that sharks cant survive on land. Eventually the badger gets bored goes out to Lake Michigan to mock the shark. Unbeknownst to the badger, the shark is camouflaged into the local environment, waiting to strike. Seeing the badger (and not seeing the latest Avatar movie), the shark quickly goes up out of the water and fatally bites the badger.


*Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs vs Clarkson Golden Knights*

Bulldogs: Its an English breed of dog, usually muscular with a wrinkled face. Despite their appearance, they usually work well with kids and other animals. They have small nasal cavities and can overheat easily. They can also die from hyperthermia due to overheating. Also known as mans best friend.

Golden Knight: A fictional character from the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. His name is Sir Percival but Merlin bestowed him the title of Golden Knight as he went into the Region Beyond.

Winner: Golden Knight as he uses a sword to defend himself against the bulldog.


#SECOND ROUND:

*Ohio State Buckeyes vs Quinnipiac Bobcats*

Buckeye: Its a moderately toxic tree found in the Midwest and the Greater Plains that effects the gastrointestinal system.

Winner: Buckeye in a stunning upset! Bobcat eats the toxic nut thinking that this will be an easy win. However, the bobcat chokes on the nut as it forgets to swallow, thus causing the bobcats untimely demise.

*Yale Bulldogs vs Northeastern Huskies*

Bulldogs: Its an English breed of dog, usually muscular with a wrinkled face. Despite their appearance, they usually work well with kids and other animals. They have small nasal cavities and can overheat easily. They can also die from hyperthermia due to overheating. Also known as mans best friend.

Huskies: Known for being great as sled dogs. They are energetic, athletic, and have a thick coat. Also known as mans best friend.

Winner: Husky as it outruns the bulldog. Bulldog becomes exhausted and concedes defeat. Husky is merciful and allows the bulldog to live.

*Colgate Raiders vs Long Island University Sharks*

Raiders: Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a raider as a soldier with close-combat training or a person who attempts a hostile takeover of a business.

Winner: Raider wins as the shark realizes its mistake as it cant get back into the water since its stuck-on land. The Raider is merciful, and she shoots the shark for the shark to avoid pain and suffering.

*Minnesota Golden Gophers vs Clarkson Golden Knights*

Golden Gophers: Golden is just due to the color of the uniforms. Gophers are part of the rodent family and burrow into the ground. They can store large amounts of food in their cheeks which are stored underground. Finally, Gophers are herbivores however can bite animals and humans in defense.

Winner: Gopher in another stunning upset. The knight goes to sleep, and the gopher digs a tunnel next to the knight; thus, the Gopher attacks when its sure that the knight is asleep and his helmet is off.

#Final Four

*Ohio State Buckeyes vs Northeastern Huskies*

Winner: Husky wins as it digs a hole and places the buckeye into the hole.

*Colgate Raiders vs Minnesota Golden Gophers*

Winner: Raider as she heard how the knight failed, thus setting up a booby trap using her combat training. She pretends to fall asleep and waits for the gopher to dig out of its hole into the booby trap. The gopher cannot escape and concedes defeat. Raider is merciful and allows the gopher to live.

#Championship Game

*Northeastern Huskies vs Colgate Raiders*

Winner: Raider wins! Husky attempted to use puppy dog eyes to distract the Raider, but she is not swayed by the huskys cuteness. She tries to get close to the husky, but it keeps on running away, still hoping that its cuteness strategy will eventually pay off. Raider realizes this thus pretends to be distracted by the cuteness. Husky attempts to strike but the Raider quickly uses her knife to defend herself and become the winner.","collegehockey",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/collegehockey/comments/11lcah2/the_2023_womens_mascot_tournament/"
2023-03-03,1677862236,"so how do things like preserved bat paperweights work, legally speaking?","I found a dead bat in my basement last night, and it reminded me of this paperweight I saw in an oddity shop years ago. If you Google ""preserved bat paper weight"" you'll see, it's literally just a whole bat in a brick of resin, you can buy em online for $30. (I would not, fwiw, that sounds sketchy as hell, and before today I didn't realize that was A Whole Thing. learning that you can buy those online is kinda what sparked all these questions.) 

Im actually a resin artist myself so I'm sure you see where my mind went. But I am fairly certain that legally speaking I can't keep the bat I found or it's bones, as bats are protected in Michigan, and I'm pretty sure you need both a taxidermy license and additional special permits to have protected species remains here. (The DNR actually does not even allow _wildlife rehabbers_ to work with bats in Michigan, which really irks me as someone who did wildlife rehab work w a bat specialist myself in Wisconsin!! but I digress.) 

But that made me wonder how other people are able to sell pieces like this from the legal perspective. Does the paperweight count as ""taxidermy""? I.e. if you have a taxidermy license you're allowed to make and sell stuff like that? Wouldn't the legality of owning it vary from state to state? _Do you need a license/permit just to own taxidermy pieces as a collector/consumer??_ google isn't helping here, it keeps giving me ""how do I become a taxidermist/run a taxidermy business"" (and the link in the about section of the sub isn't working for me rn).

but like. If you shoot a deer and want to keep it you need a permit to keep it's remains bc they test it for CWD, yeah? So you MUST, right? Or is it just your taxidermist who needs that documentation? 

Like... are you SUPPOSED to be licensed /issued a permit to own something like a bat paperweight?? Cause seeing them for sale on fricking Etsy makes me question everything... I mean we know some unethical shit happens w animal parts, and _that's exactly why you need to be licensed to own animal parts,_ but still... It really would appear to a regular layman that you're allowed to buy and sell dead bats kinda willy-nilly??  

Sorry lol I just have so many questions and googling only gave me more =5=« as someone who's worked in wildlife rehab and would like to again someday, I would really like to have my own properly permitted collection of remains I've found for personal/educational purposes (I live near the natl forest and I find dead stuff constantly, and I love talking about it so why not)... And here's one really great opportunity, this poor bat is actually in pretty good condition lmao. 

But this is one legality I take very seriously, I really do care about animal conservation, and having worked with bats already I know just how many diseases they are a vector for, so I generally strongly agree that people shouldn't be keeping dead bats around! But god damn those paperweights are metal as hell and I want one, and I work with resin and dead stuff AND I've even worked with bats so it makes sense for me to have it, I know how to make one, and I have all the materials right here... Everything but the paperwork!

if I COULD safely and ethically and legally preserve it that would be pretty cool. But idk what to even look for to get that. Do you need additional permits (like an educator or taxidermist permit) to be issued the permits to own educational specimens? Or can anyone do it? 

Also wouldn't you get in trouble for buying random dead bats off the fricking internet???? 

Anyway, sorry I'm kind of having an ADHD moment I think, trying to Google this only made me question everything I thought I knew and now I have so many more questions lmao=","vultureculture",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/vultureculture/comments/11h5jvh/so_how_do_things_like_preserved_bat_paperweights/"

Hello,

My name is xxxxxxxxx. As a xx year old rural farm living American Democrat, I have absolutely no interest in any new gun legislation in Michigan. This recent shooting at MSU is an absolute tragedy but passing knee jerk legislation will actually be a disservice to the victims. The perpetrators father gave an interview and went on and on about how his son's mental health had slowly declined and he had become more and more erratic. I want you to be the bold representative who addresses the root of the problem with mass violence and suggests stronger mental health facilities and mental healthcare access in Michigan. As we look across the country we see many mass shootings and mass violence but the thing at the root of all of them is a metal health issue. Look at the shooting in Buffalo New York, the perpetrator of that crime apologized in court and wishes that they had had a mental health intervention or program that could have helped them before they killed those people. Putting roadblocks in the way of someone getting a gun is just delaying the inevitable if someone is determined to cause harm. Taking a proactive mental healthcare approach will stop individuals from wanting to cause harm in the first place. In Waukesha Wi a man used a car as a weapon to kill parade goers by running them over. Access to firearms wasn't an issue here but mental health interventions at some point in this man's life surely would have helped. This is the common thread that ties all of these horrible occurrences together. Access and availability of firearms has decreased with every law that is passed but it does nothing to stem the problem. The shooter in the Oxford highschool shooting was in the school councilors office with a piece of paper that showed how in distress this young man was. Nobody wants to say that the mental health system miserably failed this young child and could have prevented this terrible tragedy. Multiple gun laws were broken that day in Oxford but none of them including new ones that are being discussed now would have stopped someone intent on causing harm. What may stop it in the future would be mental health interventions at the appropriate time. I truly believe that new gun legislation will do nothing to stop mass casualty events, it will only serve to criminalize otherwise law abiding citizens. Please take a step back and really look at what solutions  will help with the problem of mass violence and try to implement those. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I look forward to a reply.

Syracuse Vs Albany 20-7 Cuse:
Syracuse pulled off a 20-7 win against the Danes, which is a lot wider if a margin than I expected. I was expecting a 3-4 goal game so good on the Orange! Joey Spallina showed a lot more consistency going 5/7 on shots. Alex Simmons did great feeding the ball, and Owen Hiltz and Jackson Birtwhistle had good games too. Johnny Richiusa looked good on F/O, Carter Kempney caused 3 turnovers, and Will Mark went 67% in the cage. Great game from the Orange. Albany had a lackluster game, led in scoring by Silas Richmond (2/4) and Jack Pucci (2/8), also taking a lot of shots was Graydon Hogg who only went 1/7. Regan Andres went 11/22 on faceoffs when he was in, so overall pretty good but Nick Karnes and Austin Oppenheim went a combined 1/7 on faceoffs they took. Jack VanValkenburgh also had a rough game in goal.

Air Force vs Denver 12-10 AF:
Air Force pulled off the upset against the Pioneers. The Pioneers looked very solid after an 8 point win against Utah last week but the Falcons came in and won cleanly 12-10. Brandon Dodd for the Falcons had a 6 point day going 50% on shots as well as Josh Yago getting 3 points but only shooting 13%. While Denver was led on offense by Stephen Avery (3P, 40%) and JJ Sillstrop (3P, 75%).  Alec Stathakis dominated the faceoff for Denver, going 16/22. Tommy Hellman, Chris Bardak, and James Chastain had good games on D for Air Force and AJ Mercurio stood out for the Pioneers. Jason Rose had a good game in goal for the Falcons going 17/27, while for Denver their main goalie was Jack Thompson who went 12/15. Overall a game that could definitely get Air Force some votes.

Rutgers Vs Stony Brook 11-7 RUTG:
This game wont have an in depth analysis, but I wanted to point out how Stony Brook kept it to a 4 point game against a top 10 Scarlet Knights team. Jamison MacLachlan looked great in cage for SBU. As an Ohio State fan Im hoping this is more of a testament to Rutgers being overrated than SBU being underrated haha.

Loyola vs Maryland 12-7 Loyola:
Wow. One of the most shocking upsets Ive seen in recent college lax. Great game played by the Hounds. Davis Lindsey, Evan James, and Seth Higgins led with 3 points each for Loyola and Daniel Kelly basically was the Terps offense being the only player with over 2 points sitting at 4. Jack Brennan and Kyle Long both had 2. Luke Wierman dominated the X as expected, going 18/22 and absolutely dominating Eric Pacheco all day. Luke Staudt was very impressive in goal for Loyola while Logan McNaney played an uncharacteristically poor game. Matt Hughes, Alex Bean, and Diego Roman dominated defensively for the Greyhounds and John Geppert, Brett Makar, and Jack McDonald stood out for the Terps, surprisingly Ajax Zappitello is still not standing out on the stat sheet. Overall Maryland will probably still be in the top 5 and Ill be putting Loyola at about 16th.

Hopkins Vs Georgetown 13-12 Hopkins:
Johns Hopkins looks amazing. Knocking off 2 ranked opponents in back to back weeks should definitely get them into the  top 20. Russell Melendez stood out shooting the ball for Hopkins and Jacob Angelus did great feeding. Johnathan Peshko and Garrett Degnon also both had 3 goals. Tucker Dordevic had 5 goals for the Hoyas but noticeably forced shots a bit, as did Graham Bundy and Brian Minicus. Overall Georgetown didnt show great depth, which is what costed them their season last year against Delaware. Tyler Dunn and Logan Callahan split FOs roughly 75/25 for Hopkins and went about 50% against James Reilly. Both Tim Marcille and Danny Hincks had good days in goal. Alex Mazzone at LSM stood out defensively for the Blue Jays while Wallace Halpert and Dylan Hess did so for the Hoyas.

BU Vs Vermont 14-12 UVM:
This will be a shorter analysis. Vermont shocked BU in a close game. This makes Syracuse look very very good and could easily get both Vermont and Cuse into the top 20. Jonas Hunter showed out for the Catamounts offensively with 7 points, as did Brock Haley with 8. Louis Perfetto and Vince DAlto also both looked good for BU. Tommy Burke and Conor Calderone was the primary face of matchup, going about 50/50. Both goalies had decent games and Matt Shaffer continues to impress.

Virginia vs Michigan 17-13 UVA:
Michigan put up a much better fight than I expected. Ryan Cohen and Josh Zawada really held down the Wolverines offensively. While most of UVAs production came from the guys youd expect, Payton Cormier, Connor Shellenberger, and Petey LaSalla. Thomas McConvey and Xander Dickson also looked good for the Hoos. LaSalla took most of UVAs face offs, going 13/24. But Mac Elridge also went 4/7. Nick Rowlett and Justin Wietfeldt split face offs for UM, going a combined 14/32. Matthew Nunes had a solid day in goal for UVA while Shane Carr for Michigan looked a bit lackluster going 9/26. Grayson Sallade looked good on defense for the Cavaliers as did Quentin Matsui. While Michigan didnt really have any defensive standouts.

Jacksonville Vs Duke 13-12 JU:
Another upset as JU beats Duke for the 2nd year in a row. The Dolphins did a great job spreading out their offense as they had 7 different players score. Duke really ran through Brennan ONeill, and we went 5/12 on shots. Owen Capputo and Dyson Williams had good days too. Jake Naso dominated faceoffs for Duke, going up against primarily Nathan Kapp he went 19/27. Will Helm and Luke Millican both looked decent in goal. Jack Deaken and Troy Hettinger played well on defense for JU and Kenny Brower showed out for Duke.

Ohio State Vs Cleveland State 19-12 OSU:
As a Buckeye fan Ive got to provide insight for the Bucks. Ed Shean absolutely showed out on offense, and Dillon Magee, Kyle Lewis, and of course Jack Myers had good days too. Matthew Fritz and Drew Blanchard mostly took faceoffs and both looked good. And Skylar Wahlund had a great first half in goal but had a not as good 2nd half. Backup goalie Oran Gelinas also came in and didnt look very good. And Cullen Brown stood out on defense. The Buckeyes dominated the first half but stepped off the gas a bit in the second half which showed on the scoreboard.

One of those schools happened to be in a neighboring district to the one I was subbing at today. After students came in for 3rd period saying there was a shooting at that school (which I also sub at) I was following the events on news sites and Reddit as it was happening, as were the students, since at the time we didnt know it was fake. There was an announcement made that staff should check their email. I dont have access to this email, but I and the students already figured what it was about and continued on with class. As I was following the Reddit thread about the goings on, I saw that other districts in the area were on partial lock-down, which I thought was strange given that we werent, and the school in question wasnt too far away. 


I come home and look back at the thread: turns out we actually were on partial lock down and I hadnt a clue! When they have subs in the building, and know these subs dont have an email to check, why send lock down information exclusively through email? If you dont want to rile the kids up at least send safety officers and/or secretaries around to let the subs know. Obviously we werent in any immediate danger, but the subs still should have been in the loop for the sake of safety. 

While this isnt my favorite school to sub at, Ive never gotten the impression of admin here being ineffective or unprofessional. While I havent sent anyone out of class myself, they seem pretty serious about discipline and safety. Ive never experienced a real lockdown of any sort at other schoolsis this common practice for partial/soft lockdowns?

I have a buddy who know a police officer and the officer told him if I want to concealed carry in Michigan I would need to register my handguns as the Stare legally requires all people moving to MI to register. He said the states very picky about this and I could get in trouble if I get my CPL in Michigan but dont register my firearms. I read the posted thread stating I dont need to do this (I think). Am I not understanding this right or is this just a cop blowing smoke up my ass?

2023-03-06,1678138104,"Safe States to Move While Off Registry","Since I've been struggling with looking for a place to move being off-registry due to an extreme lack of information, I thought it might be helpful to others to have a place where I can compile all my research.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE AND WILL LIKELY BE HIGHLY DEPENDANT ON YOUR PERSONAL CASE, SO PLEASE TALK TO AN ATTORNEY AND/OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

For context, I got an SIS/deferred sentencing in MO.  Completed everything so my case was dropped and expunged.  Still had to register in MO, but was recently released (though pending appeal from DA due to dumb law problems).  Was on the registry for over 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

So here's what I have so far (again, how relevant this is to you will depend on your case, do NOT just take this at face value):

**Washington** \- Safe to move and should honor release from the registry in your home state.  Attorney recommended bringing in your court docs to the local sheriff just to have a record of you verifying this so that you can go about life without worries.

\-UPDATE1: County SOR office said it sounds like I should be fine, but they're shooting my docs to the prosecuting attorney for review.

\-Update2: Got response back from the prosecuting attorney and its goofy.  It was clarified that they first look at if you're required to register in your state of conviction.  If not, then they go off of your law to see if WA has a comparable law.  Definitely super helpful.

She then went on with my specific case and compared WA and MO law for possession of CP.  The law is almost EXACTLY the same for the two...except for one very specific thing.  MO definition of CP includes the words ""or acts using any latent objects"".  WA doesn't include that...and she says that, therefore, there is no comparable WA law and as such am not required to register...

**Oregon** \- Getting bounced all over.  2 attorney's directed me to the Oregon Board of Parole, they finally responded telling me that's not their decision and told me to contact the Oregon State SOR unite.  That phone # is purely automated and gives no options to talk to a human, so attempting to email them.   Attorney believes it shouldn't be a problem, but all these hoops to jump through is making me doubt that.

**Colorado** \- Very specifically doesn't care what your registration status is in your home state.  The only thing that matters is your charge/sentencing, and should honor your registry time.  I was told that if I moved there, I would have to register again BUT would be able to immediately appeal for removal and that they didn't see any foreseeable issues with success.

**Minnesota** \- This one was a pain as every attorney I called quite literally said they couldn't give me an answer and told me to check with my desired county law office.  Finally got a hold of one that said that they exclusively go off of your charge/sentencing and since my case was expunged then I should be fine.  Basically, they can't base it off of a case that no longer exists.

**Michigan** \- Got a hold of Michigan SOR unit, says I'm fine and no requirements but to keep a hold of my court docs in case anyone asks questions.  This one is weird because it somewhat contradicts the oncefallen chart.  Possible change since 2022 update? Or might just be more lenient due to my lack of conviction.

**Idaho** \- This has been an absolute nightmare.  The wording of the law seems to imply you're fine as long as you weren't required to register in your home state at the time of moving to Idaho.  However, every law office I've called has been either super unhelpful or outright rude.  No office has even allowed me to talk to one of the attorneys.  Once directed me to call Idaho Legal Aid which appears to not only completely irrelevant, but also specifically provides help for survivors of sexual assault so I feel like it'd be super tone-deaf to try calling...

2023-03-07,1678225866,"March Madness: A Primer on Collegiate League of Legends, Part 1: The North Conference","Its every college basketballs favorite time of year, which coincidentally also makes it nearly time for the Collegiate League of Legends College Championship. If youve never followed the collegiate scene, youre in the right place to start. If youve watched previous years, youre also in the right place to start because Riot made some major format changes this year. This primer will walk through the new format and give thoughts on some of the teams in the North Conference as we enter the final week of regular season play. 

# Conference Format

While most collegiate sports teams are affiliated with regional (or not so regional, thanks B1G) conference, most league of legends teams dont get the same level of institutional support, so most teams are assigned to massive regional conferences, while the conference that support esports have special partner conferences their teams play in instead. For the past few years, these regional conferences used a 6 round Swiss pairing system to qualify for playoffs. It was simple, go 5-1 and better and make playoffs. However, this system was flawed in that it caused most teams to only have one or two series that actually mattered. The top seeds with Challenger and GM players spent four weeks smacking gold and silvers around until the last two rounds. It also meant that one off day or week could tank your entire season. This year, they changed the format by introducing the Championship and Open conferences. 

At the beginning of the year, the top 32 teams from each conference were placed in the Championship division (no team under seed 32 had ever qualified for the national championship), which removed a lot of the low-quality matchups. Then, each conference was divided into 4 groups of 8 and each team would play each other team in their group once. Instead of needing a 5-1 record, each team now just needed to place top half in their group to qualify for the 16 team playoff. 

The second piece of the season is the 14 partner conferences. These range from just 5 teams to 20 and have their own formats for regular season play, which Ill discuss more in detail in a different post. 

# Qualification for the College Championship

Qualification for the College Championship occurs from each conferences playoffs. Based on past performance, each regional and partner conference is allotted a number of seeds that go to their highest placing teams. This ranges from 4 seeds for the south conference to just 1 for the west. When totaled up, there are 26 directly qualifying bids to the College Championship, leaving 6 open bids that are assigned by selection after playoffs are complete.

# North Conference

Now that all the boring format stuff is out of the way we can get to the results. Currently, its the beginning of week 7 of the regular season, so we have a solid idea of how most groups will play out and a great idea of which teams might be dark horses going into playoffs. 

While the South conference has won the past two years, the North conference ranked as the number two conference and receives three championship bids. That being said, Maryville University won the title in 2019 and 2017 and is almost certainly the strongest program as a whole. Additionally, the North conference had two top 8 teams in 2022 and 3 in 2021 and had more select bids to the tourney than any other conference. Basically, the North conference has the largest selection of quality programs in the country, even if they havent gone all the way in the past few years. 

# Favorites

To start out this section we have **Maryville University (1 seed, Group A)**, the perennial contender from St. Louis coming in as the number 1 overall seed nationally. Maryvilles worst placement since 2017 was a 5-8th place finish in 2018. Outside that, they have two titles, a runner-up, and a 3-4th finish. Theyve won the North conference every year since its inception, are currently 6-0 in matches with zero games lost, and have LCS/NACL veteran Niles in the top lane. Their most recent tournament finish is as the best team on the amateur circuit with a 3-1 victory in the most recent proving grounds. Indisputably the best team in the conference, every team thats in this conference is praying they avoid the 8 and 9 seeds in playoffs because an early matchup against Maryville will almost certainly end their season. 

Out of the top four seeds, the only other remaining undefeated team is **Saint Louis University (3 seed, C)**, and although they dropped one worrying game to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, this roster has nearly as much experience as Maryville. With players Airren, SkyTec, and Winnie playing for AOE Gold and CLG Faith in the NACL this year, it feels like theyre a shoe-in for one of the three seeds for this conference. However, thus far SLU has avoided playing the other top team in their conference, so tune in this weekend to see if they can take down **Illinois State (6)**.

The other notable top team in this division is **Bethany Lutheran (5 seed, D)**, currently sitting atop their group with a 6-0 record. Like SLU, they have one game loss, to **University of Iowa (13)**. Bethany has been to the College Championship the past two years, making semifinals in 2021 but being upset in the ro32 by Converse University in 2022 (who went on to make semis). Like SLU, this team has yet to face what should be their greatest challenge, **Michigan State (4)**, who they will face this weekend. 

# Dark Horses

It may seem strange to place two undefeated teams divided by only two seeds in separate categories here, but when you looked at **Northwood Universitys (7 seed, B)** history, its clear why. The Northwood Timberwolves have never qualified for a conference playoffs, though they finished with a 4-2 record in 2021. Last year they ended 1-5, but this year they had 100% roster turnover and have been sweeping through their group to start with a 6-0 record and zero game losses. While Northwood has not seen any success in League of Legends prior to this year, they placed first in the recent Valorant North Conference and winning the Red Bull Valorant World Championship in Brazil last December, so they are a respected esports program. However, the Timberwolves have yet to play the top seed in their group, **THE Ohio State University (2)**, so tune in this weekend to see the result there. 

If youre an observant reader, you may have noticed a lack of top team matchups up to this point in the writeup, and you may have also noticed multiple high seeds missing from the favorites categories. These next three teams are the reason why. 

First up is the **University of Iowa (13 seed, D)**, sitting at a 6-1 record with five game losses. Though they played in a playoff series as part of the Big Ten Esports Conference before it went defunct, Iowa has never played in a regional conference playoff. Iowa started the season hot, beating **Michigan State (4)** in a close 2-1 series in the first week, being the only double-digit seed across all four regional conferences to upset a single-digit seed that week, much less a top 4 seed. After their hot start, Iowa dropped individual games to both **University of Chicago (20)** and **Truman State (29)**, a worrying trend for anyone who wants to compete for a College Championship bid. However, they played their way back to the dark horse list with a 1-2 loss to **Bethany Lutheran (5)**, showing they can still compete with the best. Iowa has already completed their final series and is locked into a seed somewhere between 4 and 9 in playoffs depending on the outcome of this weeks games. 

The second major upset of this region came from **Purdue University (15 seed, B)**, who upset **THE Ohio State University (2)** in a 2-1 victory and sits at a 5-2 record with five game losses. Purdue has made the North Conference playoffs twice and the college championship once in 2021 but failed to qualify for playoffs last year. Additionally, theyve matches lost to **Northwood (7)**, and in-state rivals **Indiana University (23)**. Its also important to note that Ohio State was missing their starting mid for the upset. Still, an upset over a 2 seed makes this a team that no 5-8 seed wants to be matched against in the first round of playoffs. 

Our final double-digit seed upset comes from **University of Kansas (11 seed, C)**. As far as my research took me, I found Kansas hadnt made a regional playoff, just like Northwood and Iowa. Despite losing to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, and **Saint Louis University (3)**, Kansas managed to take down powerhouse **Illinois State (6)** to cement their place in the playoffs. 

When initially writing this article, I had **THE Ohio State University (2 seed, B)** in the faltering powerhouses section, then I moved them to favorite when I realized their only match loss was with a sub mid, then I moved them to dark horses when I realized that this team has never achieved any competitive success and they look underwhelming with a loss to **Purdue (15)**. But while Ohio State has never achieved anything, the same cant be said about their mid 5fire. For those of you who follow the amateur scene, that name should immediately make you pay attention. While 5fire hasnt put up incredible numbers thus far in collegiate, you cant ignore the fact that he won every amateur tournament he attended in 2021, including winning Spring Proving grounds, where his team beat teams like C9 Academy with Darshan, 100T Academy with Tenacity, Luger, Kenvi, and Poome, and GGS Academy with Chime. Of course, 

# Faltering Powerhouses

Finally we get to those missing 1-8 seeds that youve seen mentioned in the Dark Horses section. Despite losing matches to double-digit seeds, these teams are both historical powerhouses that are going to scare some top half seeds in the first round of playoffs. 

First is **Michigan State (4 seed, D)**. Despite losing to **Iowa (13)** early on, theyve won 5 matches in a row, dropping individual games to **Iowa State (12)** and **UChicago (20)**. Michigan State placed top 8 at last years College Championship, but lost their jungler to Northwood and top and support to amateur teams. Still, two returning national quarterfinalists form a strong core and should this team beat **Bethany Lutheran (5)** this weekend, theyll shoot right back up this list. 

Lastly, we have **Illinois State (6 seed, C)**. Like Michigan State, this is a team that has historically been very strong. They placed top 16 last year and top 8 the year before and play in more tournaments than any team on this list barring Maryville. Unfortunately, the stats for the match against Kansas arent available on the CLol website, so we dont know if they were playing with any subs. Still, Illinois State has the talent and experience to make a deep run, and if they beat **Saint Louis University (3)** this weekend theyll shoot right back up. 

That sums up the North Conference. Let me know if you prefer these writeups to be formatted by frontrunners/dark horses like I did with this post or give a group-by-group rundown in the future. I plan on posting one of these a day until this weekend then posting links to streams on Saturday, then doing a follow up before playoffs next week.","leagueoflegends",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lckjl/march_madness_a_primer_on_collegiate_league_of/"

2023-02-07,1675770198,"This subreddit is helping me a great deal","Ive been a loner for a long time now&Im 35 now, probably about that long. Thats not whats been bothering me, but for the last four years, Ive been struggling.  Its like I hit 31 and my mind was totally stripped of the ability to feel joy. Certain thing make sense, Id just been through a turbulent relationship with a bad breakup.  Then, followed that up with a relationship that I struggled to get off the ground over my priorities at work, leading to a breakup that I instantly regretted.  Then, the pandemic, which broke me in so many ways.

I mention the loner thing, because its what lead me to stay out late when I was young, cycling around the streets of my small Michigan town.  Its what lead me to drive twenty minutes to Kalamazoo, or from Kalamazoo, at 2am just to wonder the college campus when almost no one was around.  Its what lead me to the woods, in the snow, in the bitter wind just to feel the crunch beneath my boots and find that magic place that moonlight broke through the trees illuminating a clearing in a way&that gave me that night feeling. 

Once in college, I would leave my apartment(s) late in the evening and walk the length of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville.  Walk along the Charles, down the alleys of Back Bay.  My heart filled with joy, sadness, sonder, nostalgia&I felt distant from my present like I was living in my future, already looking back on this time and thinking, this is the path.  You are on it.  Walk it, go slow, enjoy it.

A couple years ago, I started finding those little animations by people like u/painterkira.  The first one I saw was in a fictional, I guess what I judge to be Asian city.  A man stood in the doorway of his restaurant, the warm light spilling out into the blue street, while rain falls silently.  Hes smoking a cigarette.  It conjured in me something I hadnt felt in so long time.

A lot of people my age probably feel like their life is a lot of trial and error.  Weve had a few trials for our generation that, I think, have lead us down different paths than we intended to be on.  And at some point, I got pretty far off of mine.  I stopped performing, I stopped writing, and I stopped wandering the streets, now of NYC, at night.  I remember the moment I was on my stoop getting home after a long day.  I lit up a cigarette and, for some reason, the word anhedonic came back to me, and I realized itd been a long time since I felt the kind of joy I used to feel.  I remember thinking about that second relationship and wondering why Id never felt love in it the way that I used to feel love.

The Anthropocene Reviewed came my was sometime in 2019 and that was really the first time John Green had found me in his audience. It was maybe around that time that I saw that animation.  My heart began to swell, but I struggled to comprehend it.  The depression I was going through convinced me all joy was fleeting. It convinced me that adulthood was the loss of the serotonin-hit of joy.  While I could feel it for a moment, I wasnt meant to feel it all the time now.  Its childish to feel as intensely as one does when they are a child.  

I am still struggling.  I fear I probably will for the rest of my life.  But I feel that fear alongside joy, and sadness, and sonder, and nostalgia.  Fortunately, I dont need it every day, but when I do, I can come hear for a little bit of the night feeling.  It helps to know Im not alone in the world having cherished this feeling that we struggle to describe outside this awkward phrase.  Ive started writing again.  That feels separate, but part of it.  A few months ago, I was in a cab at a red light and I saw a guy hunkered down in front of a parked car.  He was taking a picture of something I couldnt see.  A trendily dressed woman stood over him looking in the same direction at something in the distance.  I thought, I would like to do that&photography&but what would it shoot?  So, lately, Ive been wandering around the city at odd hours taking pictures.  Theres nothing worth sharing, yet.  Im still remembering how to use the camera.  When theres something good, I promise to return with it.

In the meantime, I want to thank this community for helping lead me back to something I didnt know I needed.  Thank you for helping me rediscover that I am not alone.  I am a loner, but I am not alone.

The next day was dedicated as an improvisatory memorial service, collectivizing flowers, prayers, and plastic candles near a rock with the names of the three dead -- all undergraduate students under 21 years of age -- painted on it. The entire time though, the Witnesses were there (I personally conferred with at least three), and I swear they seemed to be the closest to smiling in the midst of mournful faces, passing cards and literature for the passersby to learn more about the Bible, despite the diversity of faiths already being practiced at that moment to ease the sudden grief -- and what can be said to them other than that their religions are false and will be destroyed come Armageddon? Their very presence there, with the express purpose of only evangelizing, seemed only to beget stress in addition to that dolorous day.

The shooting started at the Union building -- I was actually there to harmonize the hold on my student account, albeit leaving two hours before any homicides. Since it is clear that the Witnesses are willing to instrumentalize such a tragedy as a means of promulgating their ministry, I was left wondering the whole week that were I to also die that day, how much could I rely on the Witnesses to exploit the execrable circumstances that would have led to my being shot to death -- it's as if they favor their faith more than physical flesh! -- or, if I was approved as a pioneer (I was never actually baptized), that I would have to preach Scripture in a similar fashion.

I was studying to be a Witness for years at this point for the sake of certain members of my family -- I was reconsidering the whole time, but this might just be the push off the precipice. Would I be wrong in concluding that? That this truly was a disgusting stunt for the Witnesses to pull?","exjw",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1155abu/am_i_wrong_in_thinking_the_witnesses_can_be_truly/"

2023-02-16,1676572012,"The 2023 Offseason (FA and Draft) - If the NFL was more like the NBA","There is a part of me that wishes, the NFL (GM's, Ownership and coaches) acted a lot more like the NBA.  Things would just be a lot more fun.  I also wish we had similar contracts and the like.  It makes every offseason, draft, and Free Agency simply wild, because of the unpredictability of it all.  

To that end, this is my (somewhat detailed) take on the offseason in the NFL, if it were more like the NBA.  This will cover big FA's (mostly quarterbacks), a 1st round Mock Draft, and any other major trades that make sense.  

Rules - We use current salary cap numbers.  Trades need to be ""fair"", but the point system is not being used. Each team's needs have been reviewed.  

**The QB Carousel - 2023 edition (Leading up to the Draft)** 

**Aaron Rodgers** \- He comes out of the darkness, and seeks a trade.  Green Bay is happy and eager to move on.  There are SEVERAL suitors for Aaron... but Aaron being Aaron, wants to only play for one team - a team that can compete for a championship and has the weapons on offense and defense to make a run.  This rules out the Raiders, who are major suitors.  Aaron's singular choice thereby completely cuts the Pack off at the knees, and lowers what they could haul on an ""open"" market.    
*The Trade* \- Green Bay sends Aaron Rodgers to the New York Jets, for 2023 1st (13), 2023 3rd (74), 2023 1st Round Pick, and DE Jermaine Johnson.   
*New Contract -* Rodgers signs a reworked cap friendly contract.  4 years, with 4th being a void option. $190 Million, with $155 Million Guaranteed.  

**Derek Carr** \- He is courted, and many teams want him more than the average lay person, armchair quarterback, and reddit user could even imagine.  These teams include, Saints, Panthers, Texans, Titans, Seahawks, Bucs, Falcons, Commanders and two surprise teams (more on that below).  At the end of the day, Carr is all about Vibes, and connecting with the team, the location and the staff.    
*The Decision* \- Carr decides to take his talents to... The Texans! (What... Surprise face) There is obviously a connection with Ownership and the Carr family, and he is a high end, quality starter, which allows them to use their bevy of draft picks rebuilding the rest of the team. Demarco knows what a good, high end game managing QB can do (like Garroppolo in SF did). Carr signs for 4 years (5th and 6th team option), $181 Million Contract, with $120 Million guaranteed.  They also promise to make some moves for teammates (see below).  

**Lamar Jackson -** Even in a non NBA type situation, this feels... volatile.  I could see this go so many different ways, and many of them are nuclear.  Lamar wants a 5 year contract, $250 Million, all guaranteed.  I simply believe that John Harbaugh and Eric DeCosta are not interested, and are looking to move on.  Injuries, fully guaranteed contracts, and I truly believe Harbaugh thinks Lamar's best days are now behind him.  So Baltimore tags Lamar, and looks to trade him, immediately.  They find MULTIPLE suitors.  It comes down to Atlanta and the Commanders.    
*The Trade* \- The Baltimore Ravens trade Lamar Jackson to the Atlanta Falcons, for 2023 1st Rd Pick (8), 2023 2nd Rd Pick (45), 2024 1st Rd Pick, 2024 4th Rd Pick   
*New Contract* \-  Lamar signs a 5 year contract (with 6th and 7th year options), for $240 Million - all guaranteed.    
\*Note - Ravens wanted Carr, but the timing did not work out with tagging and trading Lamar.  

**Kyler Murray** \- What, how did he end up here?  Well in our new wild NFL, no one is safe!  It feels like Kyler and The Cards are just not on the same page, and with a new coach, everyone just needs a fresh start.  Kyler's contract does not have a No trade clause, and so Arizona openly shops him, and finds multiple suitors.  On the day of the draft, the cardinals make the trade...   
*The Trade* \- The Arizona Cardinals trade Kyler Murray to The Washington Commanders, for  2023 (16), 2024, 2025 1st rd picks, and WR Johan Doctson.    
\* Note - Same Contract for Kyler, but restructures to be more cap friendly for DC.  

**Geno Smith** \- With so many chips falling this way, the market for Geno is relatively soft, and honestly, people just believe that Geno is a mid tier QB, and nothing more.  The best suitor is the hometown and he stays with Seattle.    
*The Contract* \- Three year contract worth $100 Million / $70 Million Guaranteed.  One year additional team option.  

**The NON QB Free Agents and Trades - 2023 edition (Leading up to the Draft)** 

BLOCKBUSTER TRADE ALERT  
**Davante Adams** \- The Raiders, after not signing Aaron Rodgers, is in FULL REBUILD MODE.  They trade Davante to (you know where this is going) ... HOUSTON.  Las Vegas Raiders receive the #2 overall pick in the 2023 Draft. Carr and Adams, back together again... 

**Darren Waller** \- Also on his way out of LV post housecleaning.  LVR trades Waller to MIA for 2023 2nd Rd Pick. 

**Javon Hargrave** \- Resigns with PHI. 4 year, $65 Million. $40 Million Guaranteed.

**Jamel Dean** \- Signs with MIN. 4 year, $70 Million. $44 Million Guaranteed.  

**Orlando Brown** \- Resigns with KC. 5 year, $103 Million. $85 Million Guaranteed.

**Josh Jacobs** \- is leaving LV after they cannot come to a long term deal. Signs with TB. 4 year, $50 Million. $34.5 Million Guaranteed.  

**Saquan Barkley** \- Stays in NY and resigns with the Giants. 3 year, $45 Million. $30 Million Guaranteed. 

**Daniel Jones** \- They bring everyone back, including the QB. 5 year, $175 Million. $102 Million Guaranteed. 

BLOCKBUSTER TRADE ALERT   
**Deandre Hopkins** \- With Kyler on the way out, the cardinals are also in full rebuild of the offense.  They Trade Deandre Hopkins to The San Francisco 49ers, for Trey Lance.  A very rare straight up trade, player for player.  

**Corey Davis** \- Despite A-Aron coming to town, Corey gets the boot for cap space purposes.  Signs for the better deal on the West Coast - Los Angeles Rams. 2 year, $22.5 Million. $15 Million Guaranteed. 

**The 2023 NFL Draft Mock (Round 1) w/ Trades** 

1. TRADE - CHI trades 1.1 to LV for 1.2 and 1.7.    
LV Selects Bryce Young, QB, Alabama.   
\- It Obviously makes sense in a full rebuild that they wanted to go after their #1 target, and build everything else around him.  
2. TRADE - CHI trades 1.2 to IND for 1.4, 2024 1st and 3rd.   
IND Selects CJ Stroud, QB, Ohio St.   
\- Chicago had many suitors for these picks.  The clear 1.1 and 1.2 QB's bring in a bunch of picks, and IND gets the QB to run the Shane Steichen Offense.  
3. ARI selects Will Anderson Jr., DE, Alabama  
\- Clearly a need, and some will have Anderson as the top player on their board. A defensive pick for a defensive regime in Arizona.  
4. TRADE - CHI trades 1.4 to BAL for 1.8, 2024 1st.   
BAL Selects Anthony Richardson, QB, Florida  
\- With the departure of Lamar, they find a player with many of the same characteristics, and Harbough and staff feeling ""we did it once, we can do it again"".  They now have many more picks and can build to Richardson's strength.  
5. TRADE - SEA trades 1.5 to CAR for 1.9 and 2.40  
CAR Selects Will Levis, QB, Kentucky  
\- Carolina wanted Carr, and that did not pan out.  They were active with other options, but ultimately, there is a certain ""type"" that Reich is looking for.  Will Levis will be his project.  Seattle always looks to trade down and get more picks.  
6. DET Selects Jalen Carter, DL, Georgia  
\- Not sure how he fell here, but the run on QB's will do that.  Regardless, Detroit is so happy.  Kneecaps everywhere are scared.  (mine included)  
7. CHI Selects Devon Witherspoon, CB, Illinois   
\- Chicago has a lot of draft assets now, and they want to overall just make their team better.  They want to address needs, but also improve wherever they can.  CB2 and slot are needs, and Devon is talented.  
8. CHI Selects Quentin Johnston, WR, TCU   
\- This is the big X received Justin Fields needs to develop.  Quentin is not perfect, but in a thin WR class, he is top tier talent.  
9. SEA selects Lukas Van Ness, DE, Iowa  
\- I personally do not see the draw here, and he is skyrocketing up draft boards.  Seattle is choosing out of potential, and there are not great options overall for what is best for them.  They wanted to keep trading down, but no suitors.  
10. PHI Selects Brian Branch, S, Alabama  
\- Branch might be the last ""blue chip"" player left in the draft and pure first round talent.  He goes to a stacked defense, that needs to make some serious decisions in the offseason with their cap space.  
11. TEN Selects Peter Skoronski, T/G, Northwestern  
\-  There is a massive need for OL help, and Tennessee scoops up the best the top prospect in the draft.  There has been a lot of talk about QB movement, but maybe that will be addressed later.  
12. HOU Selects Calijah Kancey, DL, Pitt  
\- The offense had plenty of attention so far in the offseason.  It is now time to build the defense, and an anchor on the defensive line is needed.  Size is a concern with Kancey, but production is there.  This feels like a reach - but its not.  
13. TRADE - GB trades 1.13 to ARI for 1.16 and 3.97  
ARI Selects Christian Gonzalez, CB, Oregon  
\- Arizona is building a new offense, but the holes on defense are glaring.  Gonzalez has great size and fits the mold of the new regime's defense.   
14. NE Selects Paris Johnson Jr., T, Ohio State  
\- I think everyone was expecting Bill to go WR here, but OL is a bigger need, and WR can be handled later in the draft or in remaining free agency.  
15. GB Selects Jaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, Ohio State  
\- The irony that GB is adding weapons on the offense as soon as Rodgers is shipped off cannot be avoided.  That being said, the reigns are now with Love, and he needs weapons if he is going to succeed.  JSN has the physical ability to be the best wide receiver in this draft.  
16. TRADE - GB trades 1.16 to MIN for 1.24 and 2024 2nd  
MIN selects Joey Porter Jr., CB, Penn State  
\- The need in the secondary is needed, especially at corner back.  With defensive maestro Brian Flores now leading things, he needs big, physical corners.  JP Jr is exactly this, and would have not made it to pick 24.  
17. PIT Selects Tyree Wilson, DE, Texas Tech  
\- Unfortunately they were sniped by Minnesota, and now scoop up Wilson to play DE in their 3-4 scheme.  The fall of Wilson stops, who was projected as a top 10 prospect.  Pittsburgh has many needs, but went BPA.  
18. DET Selects Nolan Smith, DE/OLB, Georgia  
\- There is rarely a perfect pick, but when it comes to scheme, matchups, and mentality, Smith is exactly what the Lions need.  he fits their scheme perfectly, addresses a massive need, and adds speed.  
19. TB Selects Myles Murphy, DE, Clemson  
\- TB is in a stage of transition, and has cap issues.  Defense will need to be addressed and Murphy has the ability to bring help in pass and run support immediately.  Value pick for a team that has many needs.  
20. SEA Selects Jordan Addison, WR, USC   
\- WR is not the greatest need on the team, but Addison is too good to pass on here.  he brings so much to the table, and can complement a talented receiving corps, but one that is thin at depth.  Plus, USC... 
21. MIA Forfeited. 
22. LAC selects Michael Mayer, TE, Notre Dame  
\- The Chargers have talent on both sides of the ball, but they need playmakers.  Mayer is a game changer, and worth a 1st round pick.  
23. BAL Selects Nathaniel Dell, WR, Houston  
\- We all know that Baltimore has been trying to figure out the WR position forever.  This is their next attempt in finding a slot receiver to provide some dynamic playmaking for a new QB.  
24. GB Selects Dalton Kincaid, TE, Utah  
\- At this point, ESPN cuts to a live shot of Aaron Rodgers as laughter roars from the panel.  In all seriousness, Kincaid is a special player, and again, offer another amazing weapon to the GB offense.  A QB's best friend can be his TE.  
25. TRADE - JAX trades 1.25 to LV for 2.39 and 2.52  
LV Selects Bijan Robinson, RB, Texas  
\- With Jacobs securing the bag in FA, LV needs to address RB.  Robinson is the clear RB1 in this draft, and is a complete 3 down back. LV still has many holes to fill, but key pieces are being constructed. JAX needs depth, and are willing to pick up more high quality picks.  
26.  NYG Selects Emmanuel Forbes, CB, Mississippi State  
\- Corner is a definite need, and Forbes has a lot of intangible skills that teams will covet.  After his pro day, he will shoot up draft boards and will likely end in the first round.  WR is where the Giants wanted to go here, but the options were not what they were looking for.  
27. DAL Selects Zay Flowers, WR, Boston College  
\- This feels like a Jerry Jones pick.  A very special and electric player, that will have limitations at the next level.  But what Flowers brings is 4.3 speed, and change of direction / separation.  That is something the Cowboys were lacking down the stretch.  
28. BUF Selects Broderick Jones, T, Georgia  
\- The Bills cannot race to the podium fast enough with this selection.  Jones is a talented tacklem who gave up zero sacks in 2022.  Some have him as a top 10 player.  Yet here he is, falling into the Bills' lap.  
29. CIN Selects Deonte Banks, CB, Maryland  
\- The team has a definite need at CB, and Banks has so much raw talent and physical attributes, they need to give it a shot.  Overall, this team is fairly complete, except for a few key pieces, and hopefully Banks develops into a foundational CB1.  
30. NO Selects Tanner McKee, QB, Stanford  
\- After striking out with the big name Quarterbacks prior to the draft, and limited draft capital and cap room, they turn to McKee for their future.  A prototypical QB prospect - size and arm for days!  Will this pocket passer translate into the new NFL? 
31. TRADE - PHI trades 1.31 to HOU for 2.34 and 4.105  
HOU Selects O'Cyrus Torrence, G, Florida  
\- Houston is making big moves on both lines, and Torrence is a day 1 starter.  Strong in run blocking, but does not give up sacks either.  Has the size for the next level, and just a very low risk pick.  
32. KC selects Mazi Smith, DL, Michigan   
\- KC is looking to bolster its line and provide depth, especially against the rush.  After a superbowl win, all picks feel like luxury picks.  

And that wraps the 2023 NFL Draft - I hope you all enjoyed this year's production!  

\---

**The QB Carousel - It Continues (After the Draft)** 

Now that the dust has settled, and Quarterbacks have new homes, some teams and some quarterbacks were left out in the cold.   

**Baker Mayfield** \- He is looking to revive his career, and wants somewhere where he can spread his wings and prove that he is worthy of being a starter in the NFL.  His choices are to wait until a team needs him (injury or other), or sign somewhere as a bridge QB, and make an argument to be the starter.  he decides to go and be a bridge QB, and attempt to earn that comeback player of the year for 2023.      
*The Decision* \- Baker Signs with New Orleans.  he gets a 1 year prove it deal, with an option for a second year.  Baker will not get a long term commitment, but he will get the ability to make his case.  let's see if he has any New Orleans magic.  

**Jimmy Garrappolo** \- Always a bridesmaid... never the bride.  The very last domino to fall. Unwanted in San Francisco, and no clear suitors.   I am unsure if there has ever been a more winning quarterback, that has been so universally under appreciated by the entire league.  It is truly shocking.  With options drying up, he ends up in the one place that no one expected, and yet everyone did.    
*The Decision* \- Jimmy gets an opportunity to compete for the newly vacated and open QB1 position in Tampa Bay.  It will be Jimmy G versus Kyle Trask, to be the next heir apparent to Tom Brady.  he gets a 3 year deal, but almost none of it outside the first year is guaranteed.  

\---

Anyway, I spent way too much time on this that will 100% never happen.  For next year, I will try to incorporate some three team trades, and somehow get Kyrie to break up the Cowboys.

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.

Some people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.

I watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped themselves, at the end.

### Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State

While Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State. Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion for the next names up.

I thought throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes, and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three  although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball through a big hit.

Obviously Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown, including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day. However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly on multiple occasions.

### Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane

Unless youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked 1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over 1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the Year.

Spears was the biggest winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut schemes the second practice.

More importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden, where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched the ball during full team period.

Still, Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

### Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State

Now combining the running back position and the school I started with in Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021, Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team All-Mountain West accolades.

While his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he simply didnt lose many reps.

In team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions. That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards) early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

### Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty

Just a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish, losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the air as the next four players combined.

The first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one, because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a window for the ball to arrive.

Douglas made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was voted the WR of the Week for that side.

### Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford

This guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again big-time during Senior Bowl week.

There were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running. Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back to the QB.

Along with the way he was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline, after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action, where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

### Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State

These all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular. Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards in each of them.

Day one, this guy kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on. Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by DBs untouched basically.

During team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro, he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually during those drills.

### Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State

Now, on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11 passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.

When you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple of steps on the DB.

However, hed also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the 16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

### Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland

I had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all but three of his final 42 games.

Athleticism was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback. His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never lined up at Maryland.

With that being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order to create movement in the run game on top of that.

### Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA

I had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C. States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league coaches.

We had a lot of powerful interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones, and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was able to ride that guy past the QB.

I dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos, to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340 pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that, he was named the West IOL of the Week.

### Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota

Its not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the country this past season.

Everything this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once looping around towards the center.

During team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each, and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one of them.

### Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State

I really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall, Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier, but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for 33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes batted down at the line.

The question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at 342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.

Watching him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

### Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia

This has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to first-team all-conference the latter two years.

After lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give him ground.

Yet, Stills mightve been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him, to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through, trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting another one on the last defensive play for the East.

### Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin

Unlike the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned. Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10) and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.

Since I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.

In run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display, winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside. Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his effort chasing away from the play.

### Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee

A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer to an early day three prospect.

And what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage. During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck for the interception.

In team run drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his hands, to slither around them.

### Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State

While I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety, outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.

After showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside, you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two, once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.

On top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen  not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly. Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine invite.

### Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina

A position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two sacks across his two seasons there.

1. She was in sixth grade [by her own admission] at the time. [Sandy Hook was/is an elementary school with a curriculum ending at fourth grade]

2. Her injuries [a fractured back] were the product of [again by her own admission] PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder. A **psychological** disorder associated with trauma.

3. The MSU campus is home to 50,000 students across a 5,000 acre campus. Jackie Matthews victim status, would be the equivalent of a person residing in a large town [a large town is defined as a pop of 20,000+] claiming to be the victim of a crime in the next town over.

This is not to diminish the suffering of the students [particularly the three students killed] rather to highlight the unusual circumstances of a crime committed at a place as large as DisneyWorld followed by someone at Epcot Center claiming to be a victim.

I come from a place with a lot of shootings, like way more. But when I thought I could take my chances here in Michigan this happens. Another fatal shooting one where multiple people get injured and the devastating losses of others. My panic attacks came almost instantly, I barricaded my door. With my fire extinguisher in hand, waiting possibly for the worst to happen. Crickets for hours and confusion from the police. I did not know who to believe. That was until finally the article came out about the shooter. Relief but also panic washed over me. Thinking, why do I have to live in fear where in some places there is none. I now believe I'm not safe, the safety blanket has been taken from me. I don't know if it can ever be replaced. 

Can we all get together to talk, let our words flow without any drawbacks? I want to set candles down and flowers but I'm unsure if it's the right thing to do.

Mourn, and become stronger together.

After speaking with a HLS grad, he strongly advised against applying ED to any schools.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share this as both a set of data points as well as for further information for reverse splitters that may look at this post in the future.

I am a nURM 16mid and 4.0X applicant from the midwest who first started at an unknown (and pretty shitty) tiny state school (100% acceptance rate and average ACT 0f 20) and then transferred to my state's most well-known public university and graduated with highest distinction with a very common major and minor. I was in the honors program and wrote a thesis. I have 2 years of fairly impressive and unique work experience (at least I think it is) mostly relating to small business. I had just 2 academic LOR's, both written by professors at my university (both oversaw my thesis work). I think I am correct in assuming that both of these LOR's were excellent.

Below are my results (still waiting on 8 out of the 27 I applied to).

Yale - R

Stanford - Pending

UChicago - WL (sad face, but expected)

Harvard - R

UPenn - WL

NYU - Pending

**UVA - Accepted (pending scholly info)**

Notre Dame - WL (sad face)

**Iowa - Accepted ($$$$)**

**UNebraska - Accepted ($$$$)**

My results say a lot of things, but namely it shows that stats aren't *EVERYTHING.* Yes, they are foundational and truly do set the bar for the range of schools you should probably target, but as long as you're above at least one median, I would say shoot for the moon. I could be wrong here, but it does seem like this cycle in particular has been great for reverse splitters and not as great for traditional splitters. I am also SHOCKED at how many extremely high-stat applicants are getting WL'd left and right this cycle.

Furthermore, I think my results show that schools are generally more holistic than most people think. To be a nURM male Midwesterner and a state-school graduate sounds pretty generic. However, in the context of law school applications, I think I am a pretty unique applicant, and I believe that there are a lot of top schools out there that highly value applicants that don't fit into normalized and overrepresented pools of identification such as geographic location, social background, and specific  areas of work experience.

I think what really carried me was my GPA (#1), my unique work experience (#2), and my written materials (#3) - personal statement, diversity statement, Why X essays, and other optional essays,

If you would have asked me 4 or 5 months ago where I wanted to attend, I thought most likely WashU and that I would probably have to ED in order to get accepted. Never in a million years did I think that I would get 10+ acceptances off of this list (that's actually why I applied to this many schools to begin with - I thought I would maybe get 5 A's at the most), let alone receive 5 full rides (and one being more than full tuition).

I am in the process of visiting schools right now (just visited GULC this weekend and LOVED it) and I am hoping to have a seat deposit placed by April 1st at the very latest. It really is going to come down to money for me (I am very debt averse) and I will probably spend a good chunk of March negotiating with schools.

This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!

Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.

 

Hello,

I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.   


The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.

Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.

If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.

We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.

I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.

Thank you,

The email talked about the importance of creating inclusive environments and taking care of each other, but it was as cold as a robot's circuits. And that's because it was! At the bottom of the email, they even admitted that it was paraphrased from ChatGPT. Oops.

2023-03-04,1677904536,"Top Prospects who probably wont play in March Madness","Heres a list of some of the top college prospects who probably wont in March Madness, so this might be your last week to see them (and for them to make an impression). 

**Cam Whitmore**: Villanova is not going to make the NCAA Tournament unless they win the Big East Tournament (highly unlikely). Its been a rough year for Villanova. Whitmore has also fallen a bit in recent mock drafts due to his lack of playmaking, potential size concerns, and average efficiency. Hes still really young (still 18) and was great in FIBA last summer. Should still be a top 10 pick, but he has no way to move up in March. 

**Taylor Hendricks**: UCF will not make the NCAA Tournament unless they win their conference. Given Houston is in their conference, thats highly unlikely. Hendricks is nearly shooting 50/40/80 on the year with good offensive and defensive impact metrics. He was ranked lower than 50 in his HS rankings, so hes not a name everyone is familiar with. Theres also some concerns with his ability to be an off the dribble scorer and level of competition, but his analytics profile is amazing. I think he should be a top 10 pick, even if Im in the minority. 

**Jett Howard**: Michigan is a bubble team. Theyll need to win at least a few games in the Big 10 Tournament to make the NCAA Tournament. They snuck in last year, so they have a shot. Hell be an interesting prospect to watch if he does somehow make the tournament. Hes been banged up the last few weeks and his FG% has dropped the second half of the season. But hes got great length, is the son of an NBA player, and fits the mold of a modern wing. One thing to keep in mind is that Michigan has a great shot be an NIT team even if they dont make the NCAA Tournament. So he might still have a few more games. 

**GG Jackson**: Unless South Carolina wins the SEC Tournament, his season is over. They most likely wont even win more than 2 games in the SEC Tournament, so hes only got a few more games in his season left. Hell solely be judged on his age, potential, and shot creation ability. He has a terrible analytical profile on offense and defense, so if you take him, itll be a gamble. 

**Maxwell Lewis**: His season is already over because Pepperdine lost in the WCC Tournament. Despite a strong start to the season, he shot roughly 40% FG and 27% 3PT in WCC play, which tanked his season long stats. Hes hard to project because he struggled against better competition but looks good in highlights. I think hes more of a Duncan Robinson 3 point specialist with subpar defense than the elite 3-D player others are projecting him to be. There is a chance he can fall to the bottom of the first/second round, as hell have to try to impress at the combine with no more games left. 

**Brice Sensabaugh**: Ohio State has to win the Big 10 Tournament for them to get into the NCAA Tournament. This isnt going to happen, so Sensabaugh only has a few more games left. He wont really change his draft stock though because its clear people have already made up their minds on him: highly efficient shooter whos not athletic and not a good defender. I dont think him playing/not playing in March changed his projected draft position. 

Others (later picks): **Judah Mintz** (Syracuse), **Baba Miller** (Florida State), **Brandin Podziemski** (Santa Clara), **Kobe Bufkin** (Michigan - same situation as Jett Howard above), **DaRon Holmes II** (Dayton - has a &gt; 10% chance to win their conference tournament), **Jalen Pickett** (Penn State - on the bubble and probably needs at least 1 Big Ten tournament win), **Emoni Bates** (Eastern Michigan), **Grant Sherfield** (Oklahoma), **Matthew Cleveland** (Florida State),  **Dillon Jones** (Weber State), **Taevion Kinsey** (Marshall if they dont win their conference tournament), **Maxwell Abmas** (Oral Roberts if they dont win their conference tournament), and **Jalen Slawson** (Furman if they dont win their conference tournament). 

An **important thing** to also note is that if Arkansas loses out (loses to Kentucky this weekend and in the first round of the SEC Tournament), they will be on the bubble. They probably should still make it, but its not a lock. They have 4 projected NBA prospects (**Anthony Black, Nick Smith Jr, Ricky Council IV, and Jordan Walsh**)

These have prompted a response known as ""swatting,"" where law enforcement swarms a location where a crime is reportedly in progress. Swatting incidents can be particularly dangerous, as officers often enter with force, guns drawn.

https://youtu.be/6VQmPTU-GoI

Our country is going through a crisis of monumental proportions. An infection is spreading across city to city, state to state. I have watched this infection destroy WA state when I lived there and now my beloved Oregon finds itself in a sort of Frontline battle in this culture and material war. Michigan has entered the battle as well. What is this war you ask? It is the war of controlling States and the primary cause of infection is the antigun neoliberal Gentrifier. As I have witnessed State's fall to the gentrifier I have noted three key barometers of the infection:


Stage 1 *Reversible* Initial Infection- 


It begins innocently enough. For your state it was with the legalization of legal cannabis and the then ensuing rush of work from home tech workers moving to Michigan during 2020/2021 COVID to buy properties for cheap thus helping to accelerate the gentrification of places like Detroit &amp; Grand Rapids. These folks often come from states like CA &amp; NY which are often in the 3rd stage of infection so they don't bring with them any interest or desire for guns and their associated culture and legal availability. They also tend to vote blue no matter who. In this stage laws like I-594  in WA get passed to appease these voters scared of the ""gun toting RetHugLicAns"" in their new home. For Michigan it was the now known FBI fueled plot to kidnap Gov Whitmer and the anti COVID open carry protests at the Michigan capitol combined with Republican stupidity on issues like abortion that led to stage 2.

Stage 2 *Reversible* *YOU ARE HERE* Legislative Takeover-

This stage comes very quickly...usually in only 1 election cycle. It can come like the 2018 election did in WA with the passage of a ballot initiative like I-1639 and with WAs previous Red legislature going full blue(erasing the purple balance that held back the worst of gun control laws). Or in WA the 2020 election where antigun AG Bob Ferguson retained his throne and the legislature grew even more blue.  *You are here now* with all branches of State government under antigun Gentrifier control. Michael Bloomberg pays large amounts of stop and frisk bucks to any politicians voting for and passing antigun legislation. This session the laws at surface level may look not that bad but red flag laws, carry bans, and bans on private transfers will lead the roadwork to worse civil liberties infringements later.


Stage 3 *TERMINAL* Runaway Train- The infection cannot be contained because despite passing terrible antigun laws the antigun politicians are essentially forever guaranteed reelection by the vote blue no matter who gentrifier's which have now taken over most cities and towns in your state. WA state is at this point now. Rent &amp; House prices are unaffordable for most locals. Neighborhoods lose their entire culture in exchange for Chipotle's®, Tesla® Charging Stations, and ""in this house.../BLM/Resist®"" signs. People talk about ""moving to a Free State"" in this stage but they often have 0 game plan to stop the same infection from following them wherever they go. Gun culture and gun rights dies because anyone serious about ""I wIlL not cOmPly"" does what folks in Humboldt California have done for decades and keeps their illegal guns and illegal carry out of sight from the general public. Newer generations understandably traumatized by school shootings and terrible school shooting drills are brought up to believe anyone into guns is a ""ReThugLican inSurrectionist"" and gun culture dies with the old heads. 


My best advice to y'all is contact your reps. This WORKED for years in WA and kept Mag bans and other terrible bills at bay. From there work to get progun democrats and republicans into seats of power in the legislature. Get the republican party in your state to stop making their party about outlawing abortion and ""groomers"". If you don't most folks will vote for the Democrats in our current post Roe v Wade world. If this session they pass the bad gun bills you MUST get progun politicians to take their place or you will find yourself in stage 3 of the infection next election. And make sure to be a good steward of your gun culture. Have empathy for kids understandably worried about being gunned down at school. Thank politicians for voting progun, especially if they are a progressive democrat. I think Michigan is not lost and if you work together you can prevent what has happened to WA state. Best of luck to you.","Miguns",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Miguns/comments/11bc73r/where_your_state_sits_currently_in_the_antigun/"

**San Diego State vs. Utah State Highlights Wednesday's Mid-Major Hoop Action**

**Is Nevada Safe(er) After Blackshears Game Winner?**

The Mountain West Conference loves to end the hoops night on a high note. Tuesday was no different. Kenan Blackshears 12-foot jumper, which seemed to hang on the rim for an eternity, dropped in at the buzzer giving Nevada the 77 to 76 victory. Blackshear finished with 12 points (including the most important two), while Wolf Pack teammate, Jarod Lucas, scored 28 points, including six for nine from behind the arc.

The stars of New Mexico had pretty good games themselves in the heartbreaking loss. Morris Udeze just missed what would have been his tenth double-double of the year. He finished with 18 points and nine rebounds. Jamal Mashburn Jr., who put his Lobos up one with 18 seconds left after a mid-range jumper, finished with 21 points and six assists. Jalen House finished with 18, but struggled offensively, finishing just 5 for 17 from the field, which included one for nine from behind the arc.

This game was nip and tuck throughout. The largest lead any team had was eight, by Nevada. Additionally, the game featured 16 lead changes and ten ties. Nevada was still able to secure the victory even though New Mexico shot 18 more free throws than them. 

Nevadas (19-6, 9-3) last second victory over New Mexico (19-5, 6-5), last night, was a big deal for a few reasons. For starters, the Wolf Pack now leans a bit closer to the good side of the bubble, picking up a quad one win in a tough environment. Additionally, it moved them to just a half a game back behind Mountain West Conference leaders San Diego State. 

As good as this game was, the January 23rd contest that ended in a double overtime victory for the Wolf Pack by the final of 97 to 94 was every bit as good. Both times Nevada escaped with the victory, giving them the 2-0 regular season series win. Who else is hoping for round three in the conference tournament?

Nevada has to be feeling pretty good about their at-large chances at the moment. This win moved them from 34 to 31 in NET rankings and improved their quad one record to 3-4. It also helps that they are 5-2 in quad two games and a perfect combined 10-0 in quad three and four games, meaning they have no bad losses on their resume. On Friday, they play Utah State in Utah, which could end up another quad one win. They might get one of the last four in games, but I think theyre in at this moment.

**Another Day Another Leader in the MAC**

With 17:50 remaining in the first half, Akrons (17-7, 9-2) Sammy Hunter connected on a three pointer to give his side a 3-1 lead over Toledo (18-6, 9-2). It would be their only lead of the game, as on the next made bucket of the game - a three by Toledos RayJ Dennis - gave Toledo the lead the rest of the way. Denniss three pointer was one of three long balls on the night, as he finished with 18 points for the game, while adding six rebounds and five assists. Setric Millner Jr, just missed a double-double, finishing with 20 points and nine rebounds. Toledo Sophomore, Dante Maddox Jr also did his part by scoring 19 points and pulling down eight boards. JT Shumate added 14 points, to conclude Toledos all around great offensive performance.

Xavier Castaneda (23 points) tried his best to keep his Zips in it, but every time his team threatened to make a run, it was quickly ended by a timely Toledo bucket. Akrons loss ended both their undefeated home record - now 12-1 - but also their eight game winning streak. Toledo extended their winning streak to eight, in the victory.

These two squads will meet again in Akron in just a couple of weeks. 

Joining Akron and Toledo with a 9-2 MAC record is Kent State (19-5), who rolled by Bowling Green (10-14, 4-7) 87 to 64 last night. Five Golden Flashes scored in double-figures. Malique Jacobs filled the stat sheet with a 17 point, six rebound, and seven assist game. Chris Payton came off the bench to add 14 points and 6 rebounds in Kent States decisive win. The Golden Flashes move to 12-0 at home this season.

Finally, Ball State (17-7, 8-3) is quietly remaining in the mix - just one game back behind the top three leaders - after their 65 to 51 road victory over Central Michigan (8-16, 3-8). The top three teams in the MAC have been very fun to watch and are stealing all the headlines as of late, but the Cardinals are the wildcard in this bunch. Heck, being that they have defeated both Toledo and Akron so far, they could be a lot more than wildcards. Of their final seven opponents, three of them are Kent State (who they lost to), Toledo, and Akron. This thing is still wide open. 

**Dayton Avenges Earlier Defeat, Beats VCU 62-58 in Richmond, A-10 Conference Gets Tighter**

Between a combination of getting injured players back and trying to find their rhythm again, and maybe a little bit of a letdown after losing to VCU (18-7, 9-3) in tough fashion a few weeks back, Dayton (16-9, 8-4) has struggled as of late, going 3-3. 

After being down 11 in the first half, Dayton went on a 10-0 run midway through the half, spurring their four point lead at the half. A pair of Jamir Watkins free throws gave VCU the 47 to 46 lead with 10:32 left, which was their first lead in nearly 20 minutes of game time. Unfortunately for the Rams, scoring got a lot more difficult for them down the final stretch, as evidenced by their 9 for 28 shooting effort (32.1 percent) in the second half.

VCU wasnt without their chances though. Dayton struggled from the foul line the last three minutes, going just 3 for 8 (11-18 for the game), but between a combination of VCUs poor foul shooting (10-20 on the game) and Daytons defense, they werent able to capitalize. With their victory, Dayton is now in third place in the conference, just a game behind VCU. 

According to KenPom, this was Daytons top win of the year, as VCU is ranked 79th. Their prior best win was against Duquesne, ranked 114. KenPom has liked a lot about Dayton this season, despite the lack of signature wins, as they sit 69th. 

Flyers junior forward Toumani Camara had a huge game, scoring 26 points on 9 of 12 shooting, and pulling in 15 rebounds. Camara has four 20 plus point games this season, two of them have come against VCU.

Adrien Baldwin Jr., VCUs junior guard, led his team with 14, but he needed 21 shots (0 for 7 from deep) to get there. Jalen DeLoach just missed a double-double, finishing with 11 and 9. 

Saint Louis (16-8, 8-3) defended their home court against Rhode Island (8-15, 4-7), beating them 76 to 71. The win moves them to just a half game behind VCU for tops in the league (VCU is 1-0 against Saint Louis). 

**Drake Scores 20th Victory, Moves Into First (For Now) in Missouri Valley**

Drake (20-6, 11-4) went to a place thats not very easy to win at traditionally, and won easily (traditionally) by the score of 92 to 68 over Murray State (13-12, 8-7). Because the three 10-4 teams (Southern Illinois, Belmont, Bradley) dont play until tonight, that means Drake gets to sit atop the conference all by themselves for at least about 24 hours. 

Drake is getting hot at a good time, winning their last six. It helps that they have one of the better younger scorers in the country in sophomore Tucker DeVries. DeVries upped his scoring average to 19.6 with a 32 point performance last night, including six for eight from three. DeVries 63 teammate, Garrett Sturtz, scored 10 points and had 11 rebounds, his 6th double-double of the year and 8th time hes pulled down 10 or more rebounds. Sturtz averages seven rebounds a game, a great luxury to have out of your two guard. Senior Roman Penn added 18 points in the victory.

Drakes last two games prior to this went to double overtime, so they are very happy to sit back and watch the rest of the conference beat up on each other tonight. 

**Wednesday's Best Features Another MWC Biggie, and Important MVC Games**

All season I have called the MWC the MVC or the MVC the MWC or put MWC teams in the MVC or put MVC teams in the MWC. For the life of me, I cant figure out why I get so confused by those initials so often.

Anywho&

In the (*checks notes*) MWC, Utah State (19-5, 8-3) will get another chance to earn a quad one win AND move into a tie for first in the conference with a win. If you remember, and even if you dont, because Im going to remind you, Utah State defeated New Mexico in Logan on Feb 1st. The game started as a quad one game for Utah State, but stands as a quad two win because the loss dropped New Mexico to a quad 2 win. New Mexicos loss last night doesnt improve Utah States postseason aspirations, but a win at home tonight against San Diego State certainly will.

In the (*checks notes*) MVC, 10 of the 12 teams take the court. Belmont (17-8, 10-4) and Bradley (17-8, 10-4) will have to win road games to join Drake as leaders of the conference. Belmont will have to beat Missouri State (12-12, 8-6 and 8-3 at home) and Bradley will have to get by Illinois State (10-15, 5-9, and 7-5 at home). Bradley needed overtime to beat Illinois State back on Jan. 25.

Staying home in MVC action and trying to join Drake are the Salukis of Southern Illinois (18-7, 10-4). They will do just that if they can beat UIC (10-15, 2-12). Finally, Indiana State (16-9, 9-5), can either become the lone 10-5 team in the division, or join one of the other 10-4 trio with a win at home against Valpo (10-15, 4-10). 

Other games to keep an eye on this evening include -

Vermont (13-10, 7-2) at Maine (10-13, 4-6). Maine, one of the younger squads in the country, are playing much better of late, winning four of five. Vermont beat them handily in mid-January, and are playing better themselves now that they are healthy., but this could be a good one between two hot teams meeting at the right time.

UNC Wilmington (19-6, 9-3) travels to Charleston (22-3, 10-2). If UNCW wins, they would take a share of first in the CAA and also all but dash Charlestons at-large hopes, which are on thin ice, either way.

Hi, I'm a freshman currently at Michigan State University, and two weeks ago, a gunman came onto campus and shot up two different buildings, killing three people and hospitalizing five.  I was about two buildings away from the shooting when it started, meaning that I heard the shots, screams, and sirens.  For four hours I hid in my closet, crying on the phone with my parents and sister.  I was never in any real danger past the first moments (I was close enough for stray bullets to theoretically be a concern), but the police scanners we were all listening to made it seem like there were multiple shooters in all parts of campus.  We thought it was a mass terrorism event, and I had to come to terms with the fact that the police were saying that there was a shooter on the same floor of the same building as some of my friends.  I didn't know if I was ever going to see them again or even get to come home.

Two weeks on, I can't think.  I feel like a fog has settled over my brain.  I have a hard time typing out sentences, let alone doing advanced math or writing a paper.  Any assignment feels overwhelming, but I can't take a break from school because I will lose my scholarship.  I'm in therapy, but there's only so much you can do on a zoom call that's not technically even supposed to be happening because you're out of state.  I shake uncontrollably at random times and can't watch a lot of the shows that I like because they have gun violence and sirens in them.  I can't stop thinking about the what ifs and whys (why wasn't it me, it could have been me). I have to bike past the places where people died every day.  I just want everything to stop, but everything has to keep going because other people have lives too.

I guess my question is how do I even start to heal?  I've looked into trauma therapy, but there's so much discourse on whether or not things like EMDR even work that I can't sift through it all.  Our psych services are overloaded with traumatized kids, so that's a no-go.  My profs are super nice and are giving grace on assignments, but if this lasts for more than two weeks more (after spring break), I'm not sure if that will be the case anymore.  I can't take a semester off because I'm only here on scholarship and that goes away if I drop.  I can't just stop my classes because I need grad school.  I can't go home early because I have a lab job that people need me to do, and if I somehow can swing it, then I'm just miserable in another state.  I feel like my life has been ripped away from me.  My parents keep telling me that I've gotta move on, and while I know they're right, it feels like telling someone they have to finish a marathon while that person is stuck in quicksand.  I'm mentally exhausted and everyone knows it.  How do I even start to put my life back together again?","traumatoolbox",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/11dp7jq/how_do_i_even_start_to_heal/"

# UFO Shot Down Over Michigan on Sunday

Another UFO has been shot down at 2:42PM EST on Sunday. A F-16 fired an AIM9x to shoot down an airborne object flying at approximately 20,000 feet over Lake Huron in Michigan. The location of the shot was chosen to reduce risk to people on the ground and improve chances for recovery. NORAD detected the object Sunday morning and said based on its flight path and data they can reasonably connect this object to the radar signal picked up over Montana, which flew in proximity to sensitive DOD sites. They did not consider it a military threat to anything on the ground, but a safety hazard to civilian aircraft and threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities.

# UFO Shot Down Over Canada on Saturday

NORAD detected a UFO over Alaska late on Friday. U.S. fighter jets monitored it as it crossed over into Canadian airspace where they were joined by Canadian aircraft. The object was aloft at 40,000 feet and said to pose a risk to civilian aircraft. A U.S. F-22 then shot down the object in Canadian territory on Saturday at 3:41 EST. Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand declined to speculate about the origin of the object, which she said was cylindrical in shape.

# UFO Shot Down Over Alaska on Friday

The White House said a 'high-altitude object' has been shot down over Alaska on Friday. The President ordered the shootdown, but the origin of the object it yet to be determined. The order was made as it posed a thread to the safety of civilian flights, out of an abundance of caution, and the recommendation of the Pentagon. The object was first surveilled by fighter jets Thursday night and then again this morning.

Current details:

* Detected by ground radar and shot down at 1:45PM EST
* Unmanned object size of a small car flying around 40,000 feet.
* ""All I say is that it wasn't 'flying' with any sort of propulsion, so if that is 'balloon-like' well -- we just don't have enough at this point.""
* Described as ""cylindrical and silver-ish gray"" and seemed to be floating.
* Recovery effort will be made and are moving towards the site, but no current timeline.

He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.

Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.

This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.

He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.

Lawmakers across the country have filed hundreds of pieces of anti-transgender legislation for the 2023 session, setting out to further marginalize a community of people who already faced a year of unprecedented violence and threats to their existence.

While the media often portrays the anti-LGBTQ+ mission of Americas rightwing elements as part of a culture war, some members of the community, allies, and activists argue that it is best described as a (state) government-sponsored genocidefar from a nebulous battle of ideas and values. Depending on what state one lives in, various expressions of LGBTQ+ identity are actively being legislated out of existence and criminalized. Transgender individuals, in particular, are being stripped of rights at an alarming rate by lawmakers beholden to rightwing propaganda campaigns. Working in concerteither intentionally or unintentionallywith far-right extremists, this combination amounts to a coordinated attempt to eradicate the transgender community from wide swaths of the nation.

#Gender affirming care

*Definition: Gender-affirming care is a model of care which includes a spectrum of social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individuals gender identity.*

One of the strongest examples of how anti-transgender laws can be considered a form of genocide are bills that ban gender affirming care. Pay special attention to part (b) in the following definition:

The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [defines](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) genocide as any acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; **(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group**; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Legislators in 37 states have filed bills that prohibit gender affirming care in various forms and for various age groups. If successful, their states will join the [four](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/youth-access-to-gender-affirming-care-the-federal-and-state-policy-landscape/) that previously banned gender affirming care for minors.

These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 

* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.

* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.

* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.

Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.

Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 

&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.

* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.

* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.

* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.

#Child Abuse

Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.

In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 

&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.

Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 

* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 

* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.

* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.

* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide

Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 

Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.

The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.

##Classification

Definition: Division of us and them

Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi

Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.

These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 

Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.

##Dehumanization

Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group

Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin

During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 

The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 

Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.

After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 

&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.

&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 

###Drag performances

Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 

Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.

* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.

* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.

* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/"

2023-02-14,1676412034,"Megathread: Updates Regarding UFO Shootdowns Last Weekend","Over the past four days the U.S. military shot down three unidentified objects: the first on Friday near Deadhorse, Alaska, the second over Yukon, Canada, on Saturday and the latest on Sunday over Lake Huron, Michigan. The White House held press briefings [yesterday (Monday)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GQmzVDJIL8) and [today (Tuesday)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PTYDJxRbHQ) where multiple questions were asked regarding the situation. 


&amp;nbsp;

The intelligence community believes the three objects shot down could just be balloons tied to some commercial or benign purpose, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. 

We dont see anything that points right now to these being part of the \[Peoples Republic of China\] spy balloon program or in fact, intelligence collection against the United States of any kind, Kirby said.

On Monday, the US Navy salvage operations were reported to have recovered debris from the Chinese balloon which was shot down on February 4th off the coast of South Carolina. Crews found all of the priority sensor and electronics pieces identified as well as large sections of the structure.

Crews are still trying to recover the three other objects that were recently shot down and have been impeded by weather conditions. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Brussels Tuesday that two were in extremely remote areas while the third was under about 200 feet of water in Lake Huron.

Well get them eventually, but its gonna take some time to recover, he said. Other officials did not offer similar assurance.

We are working very hard to locate them, but theres no guarantee that we will. The terrain in the Yukon is rather treacherous right now so it could pose some significant challenges to us in in terms of our recovery efforts the same could be said about whats taking place in Lake Huron, the marine conditions are also not conducive at the moment, said Sean McGillis, a spokesperson for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 

&amp;nbsp;

Senators attended a classified briefing today (Tuesday) and were updated on the situation.

Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, told reporters afterwards ""this is a new phenomenon"" and described the last three objects shot down as ""very, very small objects"" and were much smaller than a car. He said at least one of the three objects carried a payload, but declined to give details. 

Sen. Marco Rubio stressed that unidentified objects over U.S. airspace is not new  but the strategy to shoot them down is. He also called on the Biden administration to share more information with the general public.

""Ninety-five percent of what was discussed in that room today could be made public without compromising the security of this country,"" he said.

Sen. Thom Tillis said theres little information on the latest objects because they have not been able to recover anything as they have off the coast of the Carolinas. Defense and intelligence officials also are still not classifying the downed UFOs other than to say they are objects, and there are no signs of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.

Theyre not at a stage where theyre going to categorically identify them. Theyre balloons, blimps, a number of other things. Theyre not from outer space, Tillis said. 

[When asked](https://twitter.com/UAPJames/status/1625544523781664768) if he thought the objects posed a threat, Sen. John Kennedy said the only thing I feel confident saying right now is that if you are confused: you understand the situation perfectly.

This is what I took away: This has been going on for years, said Kennedy. Number two, except for the China spy balloon, we dont really know what they are. Number three, we dont even know if weve caught all of them. Number four, whats different right now is that weve shot some down. Thats the good news, I suppose.

I dont think anybody really understands, said Sen. Tommy Tuberville. We all knew what the first one was & \[The Biden administration\] took so much heat after the first one, they werent going to make the same mistake, he added, and let the objects fly untouched.

If youre a bowling fan, you know why the date February 26, 2012 is historic and important in the sport. If youre not, but you follow viral videos and/or internet memes, good news! You also know this date and tournament--you just don't know that! On this, the 11th anniversary of that historic day, I'm going to tell you why you know it, or at least why you should. To understand why and how the moment happened, we need context, and to get that context, we need to go back...way back.

But first! Background to the background.

## Abbreviations, Unabbreviated

[BPAA](https://bpaa.com/)\- The Bowling Proprietors Association of America, a non-profit group dedicated to serving the needs and interests of bowling center owners.

[PBA](https://www.pba.com/)\- The Professional Bowlers Association, an organization dedicated to pro bowling as a competition. If youre from the U.S., think Major League Baseball but for bowling and you have the idea. They have several associated tours. The main one is called, shocker, the PBA Tour. Theres also a PBA Regional Tour, effectively Minor League Bowling, and the PBA50+ Tour, AKA Bowlings Senior Circuit.

U.S.- United States. Look, Im covering all my bases here, okay?

[USBC](https://bowl.com/)\- United States Bowling Congress, a national governing body for bowling which standardizes rules, regulations and benefits.

With that, some more background!

## What is Bowling? (1)

Yeah, Im going with the first style of post from [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/njckeq/comment/gza4xfk/) With that, bowling is a game where you stand on one end of an alley with a ball in your hand. On the other end of the lane stand ten pins arranged in a triangle; your goal is to throw the ball at the pins to knock down as many as possible. There are two main obstacles to success: One is that the alley is framed by two gutters; shoot too far off-course and your ball goes into the gutter and you score nothing for that shot. The second is that the alley has oil on it, which makes your bowling ball go in directions you may not have planned. Figuring this out and compensating for it is a big part of getting high scores.

A game of bowling consists of ten frames; the frame is the standard unit of play. Think an inning in baseball, and again, you have the idea. You get two shots per frame to knock down as many pins as possible. Get all ten pins on your first shot and thats a strike! Get some on the first and the rest on the second shot in a frame and you get a spare. Otherwise, its an open frame and your score is however many pins you knocked down. Each frame, all ten pins are reset.

For the purpose of this post, the last two things you need to know about bowlings scoring system are Strikes and spares give a bonus to your score. and ""If you strike or spare on your tenth frame, you get a third and final shot on that tenth frame.""

## Is Bowling a Hobby or a Sport?

I cant speak for the whole world, but if someone from the U.S. thinks of bowling, it likely conjures up one of two images. One is childrens birthday parties. The second is league bowling, where theres competition, but lets be real, the goal is typically Throw a few semi-competitive games of bowling and have a few drinks with your friends. Id call it a hobby in either context, even if it leaves your arm sore by the end of the night.

This is not bowling at the highest level. A professional bowling tournament can take anywhere from several days to a week. At the most demanding tournaments, a tournament-winning bowler may bowl close to 70 games over a week if they get in through a qualifier, proceed to the cash round, onto match play, and finally get in the spotlight on the televised finals. Thats a lot of bowling! At this level, bowling is absolutely a sport. Its actually rather physically demanding.

And no tournament is more demanding than the U.S. Open.

## Whats the U.S. Open?

The smart-aleck answer is The most demanding tournament in bowling. While true, thats unhelpful, so Ill elaborate.

Despite its name, the U.S. Open (Which Ill also call The Open for convenience sake) is mostly an invitational tournament; the Open portion comes from a pre-tournament qualifier consisting of 8 games used to round out the field to slightly over 100 players.

The format has undergone several changes throughout its history, but one of the more recent formats (Up to 2022)(2) was this: Once the field was set after the pre-qualifier, each bowler bowled 24 games over the course of three days. The top 36 or so made it to the cashers round, which pays out money. The cashers played 8 more games, and the top 24 made it to the Match Play round. Those 24 played 24 more games to determine who made the 5-person televised final. In all, theyve played 56 games over the course of about a week just to get to this point (64 if they made it in via the qualifier), and have anywhere from 1 to 4 more games to go to win the title. More on that later.

This grueling format, combined with its custom oil pattern on its lanes, meant that, for a long time, the U.S. Open was **the** bowling tournament to win. Its arguably lost that status to the USBC Masters in the last few years, but The Open is still one of bowlings major tournaments(3), and a crown jewel on the resume of any bowler. You could win the U.S. Open and do nothing else, and your career would probably be called successfulwinning it establishes you as one of the best bowlers in the world. If you can pull it off twice? You can fairly call yourself a bowling legend, independent of the rest of your career.

Speaking of bowling legends, lets go back in time about 60 years, to the heyday of one particular legend&

## Heres the Dick on Dick

[Richard Anthony Dick Weber](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dick-Weber) was one of bowlings first post-television superstars. In 1958, he co-founded the PBA (And by extension, the PBA Tour) along with about 30 other players, and in 1975, he was elected to the inaugural class of the PBA Hall of Fame.

Howd he get there? First, Dick was a tireless ambassador for the game of bowling. While Dick wasnt officially elected to the Hall of Fame for his ambassadorship (The PBA name for this is Metitorious Service), he certainly could have been. If you gave him an opportunity, any opportunity at all, to promote bowling, hed take it. The best example is probably [Operation AstroBowl](https://flashbackdallas.com/2016/07/03/bowling-in-the-sky-1964/) a 1964 joint publicity stunt with American Airlines. In this, Dick and Sylvia Wene, a top womans pro of the day, bowled a game on a bowling alley constructed in a then-new Boeing 707 airplane.

Oh and also the plane was totally mid-flight during the game(4).

The BPAA calls its ambassadorship award the Dick Weber Ambassador Award, and PBA Commissioner Tom Clark [called Dick](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/dick-weber-was-bowlings-everyman-superstar-and-greatest-ambassador/) The greatest ambassador in the history of the game.

On the lanes, Weber, along with his rival [Don Carter,](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Don-Carter) helped carry bowling to the height of its popularity in the U.S. in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In that sense, they were bowlings [Nicklaus and Palmer](https://www.golfchannel.com/news/arnold-palmer-jack-nicklaus-golfs-greatest-rivalry), its [Magic and Bird](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/699088-magic-johnson-and-larry-bird-the-rivalry-that-transformed-the-nba), its [Brady and Manning](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1923546-fact-and-fiction-for-the-peyton-manning-vs-tom-brady-rivalry)...its [LeBron and Steph](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/warriors/steph-currys-all-star-game-message-lebron-james-encapsulates-rivalry) if you want to go more modern.

Thats a lot of all-time sporting greats Ive compared Dick (And Don Carter) to, and I dont do it lightly. Thats because Weber is officially in the PBA Hall of Fame for Superior Performance. In other words, as incredible as Dick was at **promoting** bowling, he was even more incredible **at** bowling.

How good was he? Well, he was the first person in history to rack up 30 victories on the PBA Tour...a Tour that didnt exist until he co-founded it at age 29. Even now, his 30 victories are tied for seventh all-time. Of those 30 victories, several came in a tournament called the BPAA All-Star, the forerunner to the U.S. Open. It changed its name to the U.S. Open in 1971, and all its records are now U.S. Open records; for this reason, Ill also call the BPAA All-Star the U.S. Open going forward.  Everything Ive said about the U.S. Open applies to the All-Star as well, including the part about being a bowling legend if you won it twice.

I reiterate that because Dick Weber won it **four times** in a five year span, in 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1966. He was only the second person ever to win it four times (Carter won it four times in a six year span in the 1950s). A third person wouldnt join them for 41 years.

Indeed, the Weber name is synonymous with bowling royalty. Dicks wife, Juanita, was the Weber familys behind the scenes matriarch and manager and also an avid bowler herself who, in her words, did win a state title. They had a daughter, Paula Darmon, who keeps a low online profile, but who, according to Dicks [New York Times obituary](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/sports/othersports/dick-weber-early-star-and-ambassador-of-bowling-dies-at.html), has bowled a 300 game. Their son Rich Jr. managed the PBAs Midwest region before retiring in 2018, and their son John is the PBAs regional and senior tour director.

At this point, youre probably thinking Hey Emptyeye, Man becomes a legend in his field and has three kids who all go into the family business is a classic, heart-warming American story that has no drama in it whatsoever. Whats going on here?

## There Is Another

Well, Dick and Juanita Weber...had **four** kids.

That fourth and youngest child is [Peter David ""Pete"" Weber](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pete-Weber). He, after nearly 2000 words, is the true protagonist of our story. There are a few things you need to know about him.

First, Pete is what pro wrestling fans and insiders call a heel. Hes loud. Hes brash. He sometimes talks trash. Part of this is a calculated persona, a way to get you to tune in to bowling wherever you watch things nowadays. To hear him tell it, Person gets up, throws ball at pins, sits back down, repeats is not inherently compelling viewing (5).

But part of this is just also who Pete is. In early 2000, Pete got himself [suspended](https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2000/03/01/pba-suspends-weber/) from the PBA Tour for six months for Conduct unbecoming a professional, related to an incident during a pro-am tournament in Michigan. I dont know how you do thatall I could find in terms of specifics is that alcohol was involved (6), but Pete managed it. More recently, in early 2022, Pete [got kicked out](https://www.mrbowling300.net/post/pete-weber-disqualified-from-the-usbc-senior-masters-for-inappropriate-conduct-12375298) of a PBA50+ event for getting into an exchange with the wife of his first opponent in the match play round. Apparently neither she nor the PBA liked him comparing her to a female dog.

In short, the closest comparison I can draw to Pete in major American sports is probably [Terrell Owens](https://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ow-Sh/Owens-Terrell.html), another person whose out-of-competition antics threatened to overshadow how good he was in competition.

Which brings me to the second thing you need to know about Pete: Like his father, Pete is **amazing** at bowling.

In fact, incredible as Dick Weber was, you can, and I would, argue that Pete was, somehow, even better. What follows is a very brief, very incomplete list of highlights and important events during Petes career as they relate to this write-up.

1980- Pete breaks on to the PBA Tour, winning Rookie of the Year honors.

[1982-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1uL-gTjDRE) Pete wins his first title, the Greater Hartford Open.

[1987-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opD05uoEQDY) Pete wins his first major, the Tournament of Champions.

[1988-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaYAV6zPiU8) Pete wins his first U.S. Open title. [His dad helps present](https://youtu.be/CaYAV6zPiU8?t=5472) the ceremonial check and trophy.

[1991-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF_2h_H4qUY) Pete wins The Open for a second time. [The trophy breaks](https://youtu.be/KF_2h_H4qUY?t=5181) during the presentation.

1998- In his first year of eligibility, Pete joins his father in the PBA Hall of Fame, making them the first father-son duo so honored. This is far from the end of his career.

2000- Nearing insolvency, the PBA gets sold while Pete is serving that suspension I mentioned earlier. When he returns, the new ownership tells him, in so many words, You keep doing you, Pete. (7)

[2004-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gttMaJsi3tQ) Pete wins his third U.S. Open. After locking up the title, [he declares](https://youtu.be/gttMaJsi3tQ?t=5546) This is MY tournament! The trophy stays together this time. This is also Petes 31st career PBA Tour win, one more than his father. It is not his last.

2005- Dick Weber passes away at 75 years old.

And one more event of note...

## Its Been 41 Years...

[2007-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfrwwxEVygk) Forty-one years after his father accomplished the feat, Pete Weber wins his fourth U.S. Open title, becoming only the third person in history to do so.

Fast forward five years.

February 26th, 2012. The Finals of the 69th Edition of Bowlings U.S. Open. After a week of bowling, involving hundreds of bowlers bowling thousands of games, were down to four finalists for our telecast. Lets meet them! (8)

Our top seed today is [Mike Fagan](https://www.stormbowling.com/mike-fagan). Hes joined by [Jason Belmonte](https://www.stormbowling.com/jason-belmonte) as the #2 seed, and [Ryan Shafer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Shafer) as the #3 seed. And rounding out the top four&is Pete Weber, with a chance to make history.

But hes got his work cut out for him. Remember when I said \[you\] have anywhere from 1 to 4 more games to go to win the title after making the finals? Thats because bowling conducts most of its tournament finals in a stepladder format, and the U.S. Open is no exception. Heres how it works: The two lowest seeds play each other in a match; in this case, its one game of bowling. The winner of that match moves on to face the next lowest seed. The winner of **that** match moves on to the **next** lowest seed, and so on, until whoever is left standing plays the top seed. One match, winner takes the prize.

Put another way, Pete has to win three straight matches, each one against a different, fresh opponent, to take the crown. Not easy to do, but Pete has a few things going for him. For one, Pete is by far the most experienced of the four. Plus, his four victories in this tournament are four more than the other three combined at this point (9). And while coming from a 4-seed to win a title is difficult, its not unprecedented.

In fact, it wouldnt be unprecedented at the U.S. Open.

[In fact, it wouldnt be unprecedented **for Pete Weber** at the U.S. Open.](https://youtu.be/iJ6a1hPz-K0?t=3369)

## Three Games to Glory

I'll just link [the entire telecast from the PBA themselves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ6a1hPz-K0) here, if you'd like to watch these matches for yourself. If not, I'll briefly summarize all three here.

Pete gets off to a bit of a rocky start against Ryan Shafer, with an early open frame. But he steadies himself and ultimately wins the match easily.

His match with Jason Belmonte is closer, and theyre actually tied after six frames. It comes down to the tenth frame, but Pete wins this match, too. Hes now one game away from history.

The final against Mike Fagan is an intense-back-and-forth affair. Early in the game, Pete gets chippy with a fan. Remember that. After 5 frames, hes even with Fagan. Pete pulls ahead late in the game, but in the tenth, Fagan comes up huge, striking out to finish at 214.

Going into his tenth frame, Petes in the drivers seat, but he needs to earn it. He has two paths to victory. The first is to strike on his first ball. At that point, he technically wont have won yet, but just launching the ball down the middle of the lane on the two shots after that would give him more than enough pins to make up the difference. Alternately, hitting 9, picking up the spare, then striking on the third ball would give him the win by a single pin.

On his first shot...Pete stands up the ten pin.

Now he needs to hit the spare. A single-pin pickup is an easy shot for a pro; one rough analog is an American Football kicker kicking an extra point. But like kicking an extra point, while its easy, its not automatic. Dont believe me? Just one year prior to this, in the championship match of the 2011 U.S. Open, Mika Koivuniemi [missed this very shot](https://youtu.be/HMkhpKc5uck?t=4170) to lose in stunning, heartbreaking fashion.

But Pete picks it up.

Pete's final shot has a ton of history riding on it. To recap: 49-year-old Pete Weber is currently tied with two other icons of his sport with 4 U.S. Open titles, a title regarded as one of the toughest to win even once..and those icons are his late father and his father's main rival. On this shot, if Pete gets 8 or less, he loses. If he gets 9, its a tie and he and Fagan go to a sudden-death bowl-off. And if he strikes, he will win an unprecedented fifth U.S. Open title by one pin.

Of course he makes it. This isnt r/ShaggyDogStories after all.

## Its All Led to This

[Here it is,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKQOXYB2cd8) the moment youve been waiting for. Lets break it down.

YES! GODDAMMIT YES!

Pete is pumped. And he should be. Hes just done something no one in the history of bowling has ever done. Five U.S. Opens, across four different decades, at age 49. And he broke a tie for most U.S. Open titles with his father in the process. Id be pumped too.

THAT IS RIGHT I DID IT

Yes you did, Pete.

THAT...NUMBER FIVE! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

People watching this video without the context get almost as confused by this part as they do by what comes next. Hopefully this bit makes a lot more sense now thoughhes talking about how many times hes won the tournament.

THATS RIGHT!

It certainly is. Anything to add, Pete? Youve got a chance to really show that heckler from earlier whos the boss now!

WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE I AM!!

I...Im sorry, what? Can we rewind?

DAMMIT, RIGHT!

I guess not.

Okay, honestly, first things first, between the pressure of the moment, the adrenaline still running through them, and the physical exhaustion, its a wonder we dont get more moments like this in those sideline interviews or press conferences immediately after big games in any sport.

But what even is Who do you think you are I am? Over the years, the basics of the story Pete Weber has told have been consistent. The short version is that throughout the tournament, he had been getting into it with a fan rooting against him. When he won, he intended to give that fan a piece of his mind, but what he meant versus what he said were two very different things. In the immediate wake of the tournament(10) though, Pete said he was going for something to the effect of Who do I think I am? I think Im the best, thats who I think I am! in response to the heckler saying Who do you think you are? Not long after that, Pete [claimed](https://youtu.be/20iOpUsI2Ww?t=116) he was going for Who do you think you are, rooting against me? Im the man of this tournament!, which is the story he's stuck to ever since. Either way, he left out a few words.

My personal take is that the first story is closer to the correct one, for as much as that matters. Petes inflection suggests that he was asking a question and then intended to answer that question with the response, even if he's pumped so full of adrenaline that the question-and-response comes out as a single declaration. But ""as much as that matters"" is ""not much at all"".

## What Was the Fallout?

Positive! Bowling got more exposure and coverage than it had gotten in years. Who do you think you are I am went viral. ESPNs SportsCenter does a weekly Not Top 10 that highlights pratfalls, missed easy shots, and general fails in the sports world. Who do you think you are I am was the #1 Not Top 10 play of that week, despite not being a failure in any way. Pete would appear on Highly Questionable not long after that U.S. Open, and would occasionally get questions asking about it even years after the fact.

And I can see why. More than just a great celebration, Who do you think you are I am is a great moment in existential philosophy, up there with I think, therefore I am, and Was I a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming I was a man?

More than that, though, it was an honest, if imperfect, outburst of emotion, ultimately harmless. This meant a lot to Pete, as you can see from how he [collects himself](https://youtu.be/iJ6a1hPz-K0?t=4720) not long afterward.

Which I can understand. Hopefully, you do too. Yes, the meme that this spawned is great, but there was also a very good reason Pete was so ecstatic as to be incoherent when he won. Its just a great moment all around.

This victory gave Pete nine majors total. He would go on to win one more, the 2013 Tournament of Champions, before finally calling it a career on the ""regular"" PBA Tour in 2021 after 41 years. He still bowls the occasional PBA50+ and PBA Regional event.

Thanks for reading. And just remember, if you find yourself having an identity crisis, wondering just who you think you are, you can take comfort in knowing the answer:

Pete Weber is.

(1) There are several variants of bowling, most of them regional, with the differences relating to ball and pin size. For our purposes, were talking about standard ten-pin bowling.

(2) They changed the format for 2023, whose tournament took place just a few weeks ago and was won by E.J. Tackett. This year, there was the 8-game pre-qualifier, 24 games of qualifying, 24 games of match play, then a 9-person stepladder final spread out over 2 days.

(3) Like tennis and golf, bowling has several particularly prestigious tournaments known as the ""majors"". Besides the U.S. Open, as of 2023, the majors are (in no particular order) the USBC Masters, the PBA World Championship, the Tournament of Champions and the PBA Players Championship.

(4) Sylvia actually won the game, 146-144. While both those scores are better than Ive ever bowled, they are not great for two top-tier pros like Dick and Sylvia. Shockingly, moving 500 miles an hour 25000 feet in the air is not an optimal environment for high bowling scores. Also, brief shoutout to Sylvia Wene, who as of this writing is still alive at age 93.

(5) Speaking as someone who came of age in the 1990s, I can see his point. Bowling was always solidly in that tier of If I see it as Im flipping channels on a weekend afternoon, Ill probably stop and watch it, but Im almost never actively seeking it out TV for me.

(6) Pete battled substance abuse issues throughout his career. He had on-and-off problems with alcohol through pretty much all of it, and apparently went through $150000 in 2 years in the 1980s thanks in part to cocaine according to [a 1985 Sports Illustrated article](https://web.archive.org/web/20131213054804/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119663/3/index.htm).

(7) I imagine, but cant confirm, they throw in a Though maybe cut out the drunken altercations with fans, thanks.

(8) Typically, a bowling tournament, even the U.S. Open, has a 5-person final. In my search, I couldnt confirm whether they went with a 4-person final for 2012, or if the 4-versus-5 match was just not aired--based on other 2012 tournaments, it looks like the former, but I can't 100% prove that. Regardless, the broadcast begins with four bowlers left.

(9) Belmonte would win the 2020 U.S. Open.

(10) From my possibly-faulty memory, it was an interview shortly after the Open on Dan LeBatard is Highly Questionable, but I cant find the footage of it now.","HobbyDrama",28,"https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/11cir0t/bowling_anniversary_post_who_do_i_think_i_am_pete/"

Im sorry for doubting you, for wrongly assuming you were turning a blind eye to gun violence, outside of offering up thoughts and prayers after every high-profile shooting, because it was disproportionately hurting people who wear dark skin like I do.

I was wrong. I know now your indifference had nothing, or very little, to do with race. You just dont care, or more charitably, you care more about a cartoonish version of the Second Amendment, one that has convinced the majority of the residents of the most-prosperous nation Earth has ever known that tens of thousands of bullet-riddled bodies every year  in the form of murder and homicide and suicide and preventable accidents  is a reasonable price for our freedom.

Im writing this apology in the wake of yet another mass shooting at yet another school, this time at Michigan State University. But, lets be honest. The details dont much matter, neither does the location, something you made clear with your reaction to the slaughter of little white boys and little white girls at Sandy Hook a decade ago and white men and white women six years ago at a concert in Las Vegas. That this keeps happening in the U.S. on a level it doesnt happen anywhere else in the industrialized world says loudly and profoundly that this is what you want.

And to think, I spent all those years harshly judging you for not caring about my high school friend who was blinded after being shot in the head; or my brothers girlfriend being killed in a drive-by shooting; or the young man whom I tried to mentor who ended up shot dead anyway; or the other one who was shot to death during an incident that claimed the life of a Davidson police officer in North Carolina; or the one sitting on death row in South Carolina because of his involvement in the shooting deaths of two convenience store workers in the Myrtle Beach metro area.

Each of them was black. I thought you didnt care because they were black. I thought you didnt commit to doing something serious about our sick gun culture because the victims were so often black. I thought you kept making excuses about why we couldnt unwind an untenable situation  a culture so saturated in guns weve convinced ourselves we need armed-agents of the state to enforce minor traffic violations because it isnt unreasonable for cops to assume whoever is driving isnt armed  because you didnt experience the pain of gun violence the way people who look like I do have.

Historically, race has played a role, with laws saying white men and white boys were legally obligated to enforce slave laws, to Ronald Reagan embracing gun control measures, at least for a while. And it likely still does, just not in the simplistic way I had once imagined. I get why you werent moved by Trayvon Martins killing, or at least I thought I did until you were equally unmoved by coffins filled with the bullet-riddled bodies of white children.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, after the latest mass shooting well treat like wallpaper, said you either care about protecting kids, or you dont. But please dont tell me you care about the safety of children if youre not willing to have a conversation about keeping them safe in a place that should be a sanctuary.

If this is not a wake-up call to do something, I dont know what is, she said.

A 21-year-old Michigan State University student took to TikTok to express her grief about the shooting as well. Shes now a survivor of two mass shootings  the first at Sandy Hook 10 years and two months ago, a fact that she says is incomprehensible.

Shes white, not black.

Again, I apologize for believing you were blinded by race or racism. I didnt realize you loved Glocks and AK-47s more than you love my kids or even your own.

I wont make that mistake again.

Just recently he reached out via face time to John Hao, a 20 year old student at Michigan state that was paralyzed due to the shooting. Not only did he FaceTime him,he sent him game worn sneakers donated to his go fund me,he even gave him his phone number . Im not sure if names have been released but a few 76er plays have also went to visit John according to another article.

 I think harden is the first big name to reach out and support Hao

We need more players and people like James Harden.

2023-02-15,1676422699,"The mass shooting reading list","Reading through the comments about the shooting at Michigan State I was struck by how many people have very basic questions about what happened or how mass shootings unfold. I saw a lot of misinformation spreading that should be very obvious to anybody with a passing knowledge of these events, such as ""people are saying there are two shooters!"" (There's never a second shooter, and when there is they are with the first shooter). With that in mind I decided to put together an exhaustive (though by no means complete) guide to resources I've used to develop a pretty high degree of active shooter knowledge. Where possible I've linked the specific resources and given broad strokes outlines of why I think the particular resource is important. My hope is that this is helpful both for the lay public and for newer officers, particularly those who don't get a lot of continuing training on the material at their departments.   


A brief background. When I was an active officer I served as an ALERRT and FLETC instructor and designed my department's active shooter protocol. I still teach active shooter preparedness and training while doing a bit of mass casualty consulting and continue to serve as an infantry officer in the national guard. I also devoted a large portion of my graduate thesis to training officers for active shooters.  


Part 1

**Books**

*Columbine,* by Dave Cullen. The finest book ever written about that day, it debunks a lot of the myths that developed around Columbine. It also helps to recontextualize the idea that Columbine was a failure of law enforcement training. Columbine is better understood as a failure of law enforcement imagination, because most of what responding officers did that day was consistent with a 1999 understanding of those situations.   


*A Mother's Reckoning*, by Sue Klebold. Written by the mother of one of the Columbine shooters the book gives one of the best insights ever recorded into the life of a mass shooter. Also does a phenomenal job examining the failures of media and how the Columbine narrative become solidified after 72 hours. I've met Sue, and she is lovely. She will never forgive herself for what happened that day.  


*Why Kids Kill,* by Peter Langman, PhD. Langman, a clinical forensic psychologist, profiles ten school shooters and examines their motives. One of the key takeaways here is that mass murder is almost always an individual event motivated by different causes, even if the end result looks the same. Understanding the distinction in behavioral pattern between a terrorist and a schizophrenic or an underperforming employee looking to get even can help prevent the next killing.  


*Extreme Killing,* by James Alan Fox, PhD. The 2019 edition is updated to reflect current trends. Fox coined the term ""pseudocommando"" and does an excellent job at examining the different ways people carry out their attacks.

*QF32,* by Richard de Crespigny. De Crespigny is an Australian Air Force veteran and Qantas Airbus A380 pilot who came to fame for landing the impossibly damaged Qantas Flight 32, a feat that has yet to be replicated in flight simulators. One of the best books ever written about managing ordinary people during extraordinary danger. His 2018 book *Fly* is also good.

*A Norwegian Tragedy: Anders Behring Breivik and the Massacre on Utøya*, by Aage Borchgrevink. Good exploration of Breivik's descent into a subculture that fueled his murderous rage. Delves into Norwegian tactical failures as well, though not to the extent of some of these other resources.  


*From a Taller Tower: The Rise of the American Mass Shooter ,* by Seamus McGraw. Well done exploration of the social phenomenon of mass shooters and why they appear to be a mostly American problem.  


*Murder in the Neighborhood: The true story of Americas first recorded mass shooting,* by Ellen Green. *Murder in Neighborhood* examines the first modern mass shooting. Committed by WWII combat veteran Howard Unruh in NJ. I mentioned earlier that Columbine was a failure of imagination, not a failure of training. I don't want to say that everybody in law enforcement management before 1999 was an ignorant fool, but we all should have seen these events coming long ago. Columbine wasn't the first mass shooting, nor was it the first school shooting. Hell, it wasn't even the first in the 1990s. But it was the first time that law enforcement's failure to prepare and train appropriately for these events was documented on international television. It took fifty years from Camden to Columbine for law enforcement to make a significant shift in how we deal with active killers. 

*The Texas Tower Sniper: The Terrifying True Story of Charles Whitman,* by Ryan Green. I read a similar 1997 book by Gary Lavergne two weeks before the Vegas shootings in preparation for a mass shooting preparedness course I was attending. We all agreed that the first person in the modern era to emulate Whitman would cause an unspeakable number of casualties. Unfortunately, the Vegas shooter had the same thought we did and shot six hundred something people. This comes back to the failure of imagination: mass shooters tend to study the past much more than officers do. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Uniform Decisions: My Life in the LAPD and the North Hollywood Shootout,* by John Caparelli. More a memoir than a direct dissection of the North Hollywood shootout, Caparelli delves a little bit into how ill prepared LAPD officers were for the shootout. It brings up a central question for the reader: what stupid motherfucker watched gangbangers up-arm with MAC10s and Norinco AK clones throughout the 1980s and decided that patrol officers were OK with shotguns and Berettas? Spoiler alert: those same decisions are being made every day in police departments across America.  


*The Siege: 68 Hours Inside the Taj Hotel,* by Adrian Levy. Talks about what happened inside the Taj Hotel during the sprawling 2008 Mumbai shootings and some of the institutional failures of the Indian government to respond. There are alarming parallels between the Norwegian attack at Utoya and the Mumbai attacks, particularly the lack of dedicated helicopter assets to transfer elite counterterrorist assets to the scene. You can't read accounts of Mumbai in 2008 and come across and not realize that no American city is properly prepared to deal with a MACTAC incident.  


*Hue: 1968,* by Mark Bowden. Delves into the effort by Marines and Army personnel to retake the region capital of Hue after it was seized during the Tet Offensive. One of the key takeaways is how poorly trained Marines were for urban combat. Though they retook the city, they suffered horrific casualties partly as a result of extensive failures to properly train Marines on basic urban combat principles. ""We're fighting in a jungle, why do we need to prepare for house house fighting?"" is not that far off from ""we work in a wealthy suburb, why do we need to worry about mass murder?"" The book also does a fantastic job at illustrating some of the tactics the Marines adopted to retake the city.  


**After Action Reviews and tactical reports**

*Robb Elementary School Attack Response Assessment and Recommendations,* by the staff at the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training center at Texas State. Uvalde was the single worst, and certain most cowardly, response to a mass shooting in modern American history. Here's why.  


*The Lessons of Mumbai*, by the Rand Corporation. An extraordinary exploration into the tactics and failures of that event. If you don't learn anything else from this report, learn this on page 21 ""Intelligence failure, inadequate counterterrorist training and equipment of local police, delays in the response of NSG commandos, flawed hostage-rescue plans, and poor strategic communications and information management all contributed to a less-than-optimal response. These gaps suggest the need for improved counterterrorist coordination between national-level and local security agencies and for strengthened counterterrorist capabilities on the part of first responders. Unless India can improve the quality and functioning of its entire internal security apparatus, it will remain acutely vulnerable to further terrorist penetration and attacks.""  


*Peek or Push: An Examination of Two Types of Room Clearing Tactics for Active Shooter Event Response,* by Peter Blair at ALERT. An examination of threshold clearing/limited penetration  


ATP 3-06: Urban Operations. The joint Army and Marine doctrine on urban combat. Nearly every mass shooting of the last 70 years resembles some form of urban combat. Here's one of the best free resources every laid out on how to deal with command and control as well as specific tactics in an urban environment. Looking at you, Jersey City.  


*EXPLORING PERSONAL NARRATIVES: EXPERIENCING THE DAWSON COLLEGE SHOOTING,* by Kathryn Brice. An outstanding master's thesis that explores the experience of those who dealt with the 2006 Dawson's College shooting in Montreal.

**Other Media:**

Season 2, Episode 1 ""School"", *19-2.* Arguably the most accurate mass shooting scene ever filmed, the first fifteen minutes or so are filmed with an absolute minimum number of cuts. Gripping and realistic, the scene was filmed with the advice of Montreal Police Service officers who had responded to the Dawson's College shooting.  


*Elephant,* a fictionalized portrayal of the Columbine shooting. It does a fairly good job replicating the behavior and tactics of the two shooters.  


Literally anything *Second Before Disaster* has ever done, but the ones on Utoya and Mumbai are the most relevant. Love that show","ProtectAndServe",30,"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/112lesr/the_mass_shooting_reading_list/"

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially  in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous  back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to  offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.

Some  people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week  between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.

I  watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw  in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on  each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in  this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped  themselves, at the end.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State

While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.

I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.

Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane

Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.

Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.

More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.

Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State

Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.

While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.

In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty

Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.

The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.

Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford

This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.

There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.

Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State

These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.

Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.

During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State

Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.

When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.

However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland

I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.

Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.

With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA

I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.

We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.

I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota

Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.

Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.

During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State

I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.

The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.

Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia

This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.

After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.

Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin

Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.

Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.

In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee

A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.

And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.

In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State

While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.

After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.

On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina

A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season

**Team: New England Patriots**  
Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  
Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18

Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.

Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.

This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.

Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story

Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 

The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 

This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.

Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 

Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs. 

***

#Three Quick Questions

**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**

The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.

**What the hell happened with the coaches?**

All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  
&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him

This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.

The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 

So why Patricia? Well, he was available.

**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**

Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 

Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers

Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.

**Three cheers for...**  
*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*

These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.

You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.

**Three jeers for...**  
*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*

Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.

And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  

The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.

##Highlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 

**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.

##Lowlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.

**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 

Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*

##2022 NFL Draft Recap

**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**

**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.

**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**

**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**

**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.

**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**

**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete

**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete


The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward. 

**2022 draft grade-right now (B+)**
***
#2022 Free Agent Review  

##Notable Additions

**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.

**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.

**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.

**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.


##Departures

**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.

**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.

**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.

**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.

**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.

**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.

**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)

Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.

Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.

*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

**QUARTERBACKS**

| Quarterback Comparison | Mac Jones 2021 | Mac Jones 2022 | Bailey Zappe 2022 |

|QBR|56.9|36.2|34.5|
|Passer Rating|92.5|84.8|100.9|


Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 

Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  


I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)


In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 


Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles. With Harris struggling to stay healthy, and having his carries cut nearly in half [(202 in 2021 to 106 in 2022)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3925347/damien-harris), Rhamondre took the helm as workhorse for the team. Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.


In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.


All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 

While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*  

##Roster Review  
Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.

##Quarterbacks

**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  

Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.

Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.
***
##Running Backs

**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.

**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.

**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.

**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.

**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.

**Damien Harris** UFA
***
##Wide Receivers

**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.

**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.

**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.

**Nelson Agholor** UFA

**Jakobi Meyers** UFA

**Matthew Slater** Re-signed

**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.

**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.

**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.

**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.

**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.

*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.
***
##Tight Ends

**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.

**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.

**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.

*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.
***
##Offensive Line

**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.

**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.

**James Ferentz** UFA

**Yodny Cajuste** RFA

**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.

**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.

**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.

**Marcus Cannon** UFA

*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).

**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.

Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 
***
##Defensive Line 

**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.

**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.

**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.

**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.

**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.
***
##Defensive Ends

**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.

**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.

**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.

*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)
***
##Linebackers and Defensive backs

Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.

Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

2023-03-06,1678146074,"the death of Karl Heikell","11-year-old Karl Heikell lived with his sisters and parents in the small community of Centennial Heights Michigan. Centennial is near Calumet, a former UP boomtown.

On the afternoon of Halloween 1981 11-year-old Karl told his sister that he was heading out to a quote drinking party. He told his father that he was heading out on a walk. This was about 4p, sunset wouldnt happen for at least two and a half hours.

Karl would not return from his outing, whether it was to a drinking party like he told his sister, or if he went out for a walk like he told his father.

On November 1, his parents reported him missing to law enforcement. Unfortunately, police decided, as they often did during this era, that he was a runaway, they told the family not to worry, as Karl would turn up in a day or two at the family home.

On November 1, a man named Gary Olsen tells police that he knows Karl and saw him walking towards the ""BL"" home in Centennial Heights on Halloween, between 4 and 4:30PM. This lines up with what Karls family said about Karl departing around 4 or 4:30 that afternoon.

On December 2, 1981, police log a black Casio watch into evidence. The watch was found by a Centennial Heights local, on November 30, while he was walking County Road C-11A. The man noticed a watch face missing a wristband, laying in the road, on top of snow, and on the left side of the roadway.

Karl's father, Lawrence Heikell, confirmed the watch belonged to Karl. Police also note that the watch was found just east of the BL property in Centennial Heights, about 25 yards east of where the creek crosses the road if driving US-41. Ive mentioned the BL house twice now, we will get to the BL family shortly.

While weve found one of Karls belongings in an odd place  we still dont have any idea whats happened to Karl himself.

It will take almost a full year until we have some answers in Karls disappearance.

On October 2, 1982, Roger Perreault, a local bird hunter called law enforcement to report that while exploring a wooded area near Centennial Heights, he came across several articles of torn clothing. Roger along with his father, took police to the scene.

Upon arrival officers observed one pair of blue jeans, remnants of a blue and green plaid shirt, white socks with red trim, white underwear, and a blue nylon jacket. Additional searches that afternoon produced tufts of human hair, several fingernails, and a section of bone.

On October 5, officers returned to the location and found what appeared to be a femur it was discovered approximately 75 feet from the spot where the clothing was found. No further human remains linked to Karl have ever been recovered.

The remains were found approximately ½ a mile from the home Karl shared with his parents and sisters.

Which leads us to one of the known suspects in Karls case. AP.  AP grew up in Centennial Heights and remained in the area as an adult. In fact, he was employed by Karls uncle at Mr. Radiator in Calumet at the time of Karls disappearance.

AP knew Karl and likely knew the entire Heikell family. AP was a quiet and reserved person who had few friends. He was also a drinker, and was known to be a bad drinker, becoming loud and obnoxious. Those familiar with him and his drinking habits reported that alcohol turned him into a different person.

On Halloween night 1981 AP was with his friend, John and they were unloading a truck in Calumet around 6p. When they finished unloading the truck, John stopped in at Harters party (convenience) store on Pine Street where he saw and spoke with Karl Heikell.

Police believe this sighting of Karl to be credible. AP was drinking at a local watering hole just two doors down from Harter's at the time John saw Karl.

In a November 10, 1984, police interview, AP advised that he did know Karl and had spoken to him on several occasions. He claims he never hung out with Karl, never took him anywhere in a vehicle, and never supplied Karl with alcohol or drugs. He advised that it was his own feeling that Karls disappearance involved foul play.

Also, AP admitted to sexually abusing his own sons. He claims that his last contact with the boys was when the divorce was finalized, and since that time, says there have been no more ""incidents"" involving children.

During the 11-10-84 interview, AP stated that he had nothing to do with Karl's death, and police note that he was able to discuss the matter without being overly nervous. AP agreed to take and was administered a polygraph.

While the results are omitted from the report, a retired Calumet Post Michigan State Police Detective and former lead on the Heikell case confirmed that AP passed the exam. And I know how people feel about polygraphs, but they held a lot of sway in the early 1980s. As of early 2023 AP is still alive and resides in the Calumet area.

Another person mentioned in relation to the case is BL, a 16-year-old who was acquainted with Karl.

Police spoke with BL on November 1, 1981 16 year old BL tells police he saw Karl the afternoon of Halloween and said Karl mentioned trick or treating that night at Lake Linden.

At the end of November police again speak with BL at Calumet High School. He denied having any knowledge of where Karl is and maintained that he has not seen him since Halloween.

In the first week of December, BL's father signs a release that allows both BL and his brother, J. to be polygraphed. The tests are administered, and BL passes.

Unfortunately, there is a tragic closing to BL's story, according to reports from the Michigan State police in the summer of 1982 BL is caught by his parents with stolen property.

His father tells him that he needs to turn himself in to law enforcement. After gathering the stolen items, BL tells his father that he needs to go upstairs and get something. While upstairs in his room, BL uses a gun to shoot himself in the chest. BL died on June 28, 1982. He was 17 years old.

In 1983, all physical evidence in the disappearance and death of Karl Heikell was either released to Karls family, released to the Peterson Funeral Home, or incinerated.

The release and destruction of evidence occurred shortly after the Heikell family petitioned the Houghton County Probate Court to determine a cause of death, location of death, and time of death in order to provide some semblance of closure. If you were hoping for a DNA test on what remained of Karls clothing it cant be done. 

DNA testing on his remains to confirm that the bits of bone, nail and hair recovered were from Karl, would require an exhumation.

**So, what happened to Karl Heikell? Was it death by misadventure or a murder?**

Local librarian Dillon Geshel maintains an extensive website about the case. This write up is scratching the surface of what's available.

2023-02-22,1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 

\-Going back to work.

The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 

\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.

From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 

\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.

In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 

However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.

The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 

This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.

\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest

With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 

Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 

I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 

I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

2023-02-27,1677533175,"Every Possible Single Season Win/Loss Record in NCAA FBS College Football","**Abstract:** For the most part, CFB seasonal records tend to be uneventful year to year. Aside from the occasional 0-12 and 15-0 teams, most schools will achieve a record that is not unique in any way. 

However, under current NCAA D1 FBS rules, there are 59 unique records possible to achieve in a single season. Of those 59, only 30 have been managed in the playoff era. I decided to explore which records had not been achieved, which were theoretically possible, and which were outright ridiculous.

**The Rules:** Although the NCAA has many rules, we only care about a few of them when it comes to records. Also I have added some of my own input to make this more succinct.

* Rule 1: All teams must complete at least 12 regular season games. This excludes any cancellations or governing body interference. This is largely to exclude the 2020-21 season, as well as any vacated wins, sanctions, and other extraneous factors.
* Rule 2: In order to be bowl eligible, a team must have a regular season winning percentage of .500 or greater. Only one win against an FCS team can be counted.
* Rule 3: There are five opportunities to play extra games in a season, though two of them are mutually exclusive. This means the maximum number of games a team can play in a single season is 16. 
   * i) Bowl Games: You must be bowl eligible.
   * ii) Conference Championships: You must have the best regular season in-conference record in your conference division.
   * iii) Playoff Semifinal: You must be bowl eligible, and you must be ranked in the top four by the CFP poll.
   * iv) National Championship: You must win a Playoff Semifinal.
   * v) 13th Regular Season Game: You must schedule to play at Hawaii in your regular season, granting you the ability to schedule an extra game to cover travel costs (The Hawaii Exemption).

Under these three rules, we can eliminate a large chunk of the board, as we will only consider teams that played 12-16 games with none canceled or vacated.

# Part 1: The Base Records

We can go ahead and cross off all of the typical seasonal records. This includes any records between 0-12 and 5-7, as well as 6-7 and 11-2. These are the most common records and will be achieved more or less every season (0-12 records are rare but self-explanatory). 

We will also get rid of typical playoff records. This includes 15-0, 14-1, and 13-2, all of which have been done by teams that played in the national championship game. 

Furthermore, we eliminate conference championship teams like 12-2, 11-3, and 10-4. This also includes teams that lost in the semi-finals with a 13-1 record.

All in all, these 19 records are not interesting to talk about. 

# Part 2: The Strange but Understandable

This part will cover the rest of the records that have been achieved thus far. Although theyve been done, they are still kinda interesting, at least relative to the previous part.

Under the Hawaii Exemption, schools that play Hawaii (and Hawaii itself) are allowed to schedule 13 regular season games, and have done so on a handful of occasions. 

The [2014 UNLV Rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_UNLV_Rebels_football_team) went 2-11, the [2015 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Hawaii_Rainbow_Warriors_football_team) went 3-10, the [2015 Colorado Buffaloes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Colorado_Buffaloes_football_team) went 4-9, and  the [2019 Army Black Knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Army_Black_Knights_football_team) went 5-8. All of these teams played a game in Hawaii. This is not an exhaustive list of every team with a losing 13 game record, but these are all of the ones achieved so far. No team has managed to go 1-12 or 0-13, but these are easily achievable if you suck enough. 

Conference Championship games dont have many rules, only requiring a good record relative to everyone else. If everyone in your division sucks, you can play in a conference championship while still being just okay. 

The [2014 Fresno State Bulldogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Mountain_West_Conference_Football_Championship_Game) went 6-6 in the regular season, the [2018 Pitt Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_ACC_Championship_Game) went 7-5, the [2015 USC Trojans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pac-12_Football_Championship_Game) went 8-4, and the [2018 Utah Utes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Pac-12_Football_Championship_Game) went 9-3. All ended up making it to their respective conference championship games, lost, and then lost a bowl game, giving us 6-8, 7-7, 8-6, and 9-5 records. 

The weirdest record that I think has ever been achieved in the CFP era combines these two events, with the [2019 Hawaii Rainbow Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hawaii_Rainbow_Warriors_football_team). This team went 9-4 in their regular season, landed in the [Mountain West Championship game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mountain_West_Conference_Football_Championship_Game), lost to Boise State, and then won the [Hawaii Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Hawaii_Bowl) against BYU. This produced a record of 10-5, the only team in the playoff era to play 15 games and not make it to the playoffs. 

This leaves two records that have been achieved under our rules that I havent addressed yet: The [2022 Appalachian State Mountaineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Appalachian_State_Mountaineers_football_team) and the [2018 Notre Dame Fighting Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football_team). 

In 2022, App State scheduled two games against FCS opponents. They ended the regular season with a record of 6-6, but because two of those wins were against FCS schools, they were ineligible for a bowl game. This also happened to the Army in the same season.

In 2018, Notre Dame went 12-0 in the regular season. Since they're independent, they didnt play in any championship game, but still made it to the playoffs, where they lost in the semi-finals. This isnt the only way to go 12-1, as simply going 11-1 and missing the conference championship and playoffs could give this result (as Ohio State almost did).

# Part 3: Only-A-Matter-Of-Time Records

We are now moving on to season records that havent been achieved but could reasonably be. As mentioned before, 0-13 and 1-12 only takes a really bad team scheduling Hawaii. Similarly, a particularly good team scheduling Hawaii could go 7-8, 8-7, 9-6, 11-4, or 12-3 relatively easily. In fact, a really really good team that schedules Hawaii could make it to the national championship game and go 15-1 or 14-2.

What about possible undefeated seasons? 13-0, 14-0, and 16-0 havent been properly achieved but could still be. 16-0 requires a team to schedule Hawaii and then go on to win the national championship with 0 losses. 14-0 would require an independent to win the national championship with 0 losses, since they dont play in a conference championship game and would only play in 14 total games.

13-0 is trickier. For typical teams, its impossible, as an undefeated regular season would send you to the conference championship game and a bowl game. For an independent its entirely possible, but in order to be 13-0, that team must miss the playoffs. UCF did go 13-0 in [2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_UCF_Knights_football_team), but this was because they only played 11 regular season games, and UCF is not an independent school. 

As of this post, only three undefeated teams managed to miss the playoffs, and of those three only one ([2016 Western Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Western_Michigan_Broncos_football_team)) had played a complete regular season (The other two were 2017 and [2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_UCF_Knights_football_team) UCF). Nonetheless, if an independent school won all 12 regular season games, failed to secure a playoff bid, and won their bowl game, they would have a 13-0 record. 

Given enough seasons, we would likely see these records come to fruition.

# Part 4: The Realm of Stupidity

Past this point, we have to get dumb. 

All G5 and P5 conferences schedule 8-9 in conference games per regular season, allowing for rivalry games and weaker teams to be scheduled.

Hypothetically under these rules, any team could schedule 4 FCS games. If they only won four games against FBS opponents and four against FCS opponents, they could end the regular season with an 8-4 record and still be bowl ineligible, or 7-5 if they only have 3 FCS wins. 

For independents, they could schedule even more, and go all the way up to 8 FCS wins with only 4 FBS wins, finishing with a record of 12-0 and still missing a bowl game. 

Taking it even further, independents could schedule a game against Hawaii and allow themselves a 9th FCS win to take it to 13-0 without playing a second in the postseason. 

As you can tell, this is incredibly dumb. It would be a waste of time and money to schedule 9 FCS opponents, when most teams schedule just one. 

But it can get dumber.

Recall that there is no actual minimum number of wins required for a bid to a conference championship game. The fewest so far was the six wins for 2014 Fresno State. All that is required is you having the best conference record in your division.

Were only going to be talking about Hawaii exempt schools, since they can play 13 regular season games and a 14th game in a conference championship. 0-14 isnt possible, as having 0 wins in the regular season means that you lost to all of your division opponents so someone is bound to have 1 win more than you.

However, if everyone in your division only has one win over another conference opponent, then one of them is bound to go to the conference championship. If they lose, then they could end up with a 1-13 record. This same logic applies to 2-12, 3-11, 4-10, and so on. 

# Part 5: The Unthinkable

We have now reached peak stupidity. These records require a series of events so unlikely and for all of college football to collectively collapse in one season.

There are only two rules to make it into the playoffs: Be bowl eligible, be top 4 in the country.

These two rules dictate a minimum win percentage but a really low one of just .500. No team has ever made it to the playoffs with more than 1 loss, but this is not a requirement.

In order to make it to the national championship, a team must win a playoff game, so that increases the minimum wins by one. In total, a Hawaii exempt team can theoretically get to the national championship with 8 wins.

Think about what this means. In order to play in 16 games, that includes a conference championship. So a team would go 7-6 in the regular season and make it to the conference championship. They lose and are 7-7. In order to be ranked in the top 4 with a 7-7 record, at the very most, only three teams in the country can have a better record. Every other team must have either a comparable record with a weaker schedule or a weaker record altogether. From there, the 7-7 team wins a playoff game and advances to the national championship 8-7. If they lose, they end the season with an absolutely hilarious record of 8-8. This is entirely possible within current NCAA rules, an 8-8 national champion runner up, ever-so-slightly more funny than a potential 9-7 national champion. 

This can apply to any combination better than 8-8. A 13-3 team is one that could happen if a 2 loss team makes it in, which hasnt happened yet but is entirely plausible.

**Conclusion:** What is the point in this thought experiment? Absolutely nothing of course. In fact, this post only resides under current NCAA and conference rules. Once the playoffs expand to the 12 team format, the maximum number of games a team could play shoots up to 18, making 8-8 less ridiculous. On top of that, with how the ACC is changing up their scheduling rules and doing away with divisions, you could have undefeated teams that miss the conference championship, but also making it more difficult for less-win teams.

2023-02-13,1676327944,"Bubble Watch","Welcome to the first edition of the 2023 College Hockey Bubble Watch! This is modeled off Eamonn Brennan's series for college basketball in The Athletic. There are three categories of teams in Bubble Watch; Locks, Should Be In, and Work to Do. Locks are any team that would still be in the field even if they lose every game left on their schedule. Should Be In are any team that would feel comfortable even if they finish poorly down the stretch, and Work to Do is any team that needs to win more games to be safely in the field of 16. Of course college hockey selects its tournament field based off the Pairwise rankings, rather than college basketball's selection committee. Odds of making the tournament are pulled from [PlayoffStatus.com](https://playoffstatus.com).  


#**Atlantic Hockey**
Since its founding in 2003, Atlantic Hockey has only had two teams in the tournament once, in 2013, when Canisius got the auto-bid and Niagara earned an at large. AIC has been the representative in the last three tournaments, but the Yellowjackets sit third at this point in the conference standings and 41st in the Pairwise. RIT leads the conference but has less than a 1% chance of earning an at-large bid. As such, nobody from AHA is on Bubble Watch and the conference will once again be represented by their tournament champion alone.  

 
#**Big Ten**  
The Big Ten has traditionally been seen as tied for the second best conference behind the NCHC, but is clearly the nation's top league this season. The conference has three locks in Minnesota, Michigan, and Penn State and six of the seven members sit in the top 16 of the Pairwise currently. Minnesota has sat at the top of the Pairwise for several weeks now and is poised to claim the top seed in the tournament. Michigan's strong non-conference scheduled buoyed their Pairwise while the Wolverines struggled in conference play, but have since rattled off seven straight wins, including a sweep over rivals Michigan State this weekend. Penn State played a very week non-conference slate, but went 10-0, bolstering their RPI and securing a spot in the field when combined with the tough Big Ten schedule.   

**Locks:** Minnesota, Michigan, Penn State  
**Should Be In:** Ohio State  
**Work to Do:** Michigan State, Notre Dame  

**Ohio State (17-11-2, PWR: 9, At Large Odds: 85%):** Ohio State collapsed last season at the end, costing themselves a tournament bid, but this year's Buckeyes are looking to avoid a similar fate. They do finish the regular season with series against Michigan and Minnesota, but Ohio State has earned splits against both earlier in the season. Earning a home Big Ten Tournament series will likely require 3-5 points.  

**Michigan State (15-15-2, PWR: 14, At Large Odds: 33%):** New coach Adam Nightingale has the Spartans in tournament contention in mid-February for the first time since the beginning of the Anastos era. Getting swept by Michigan this past weekend did not help the cause. MSU will likely need to sweep Wisconsin this upcoming weekend in their final regular season series and win a first round conference tournament series to make the field.  

**Notre Dame (14-14-4, PWR: 16, At Large Odds: 32%):** The Fighting Irish bounced back from a devastating road sweep at the hands of Michigan State to get a win and a tie against Ohio State this past weekend to get themselves back in the conversation. ND is currently the first team out of the field. Staying at .500 to maintain eligibility for an at-large bid is tantamount, but they finish their regular season in two weeks against Michigan at Yost. Getting a split is key.  


#**CCHA:**    
The sophomore season of the new CCHA doesn't have a contender for a top seed, as it did last year in Minnesota State, but it does have a chance at being a multi-bid league once again. The conference's non-conference winning percentage is down significantly from .478 to .429, damaging the RPI of the teams on the bubble.  

**Work To Do:** Michigan Tech, Minnesota State  

**Michigan Tech (21-8-4, PWR: 12, At Large Odds: 50%):** Tech has been on a tear in the last three weeks, winning five of six to keep pace with Minnesota State at the top of the CCHA standings. Non-conference wins over Michigan State in the GLI Consolation and Boston University bolster a relatively weak strength of schedule (30th) for a bubble team. The Huskies will likely need to make a run in the CCHA Tournament to earn a second straight trip to the NCAAs.  

**Minnesota State (19-10-1, PWR: 13, At Large Odds: 27%):** Coming off a devastating loss in the national championship to Denver last year, the Mavericks have not been able to quite replicate the dominance they have shown in recent seasons.  They've been good in conference play, but were swept at home by Bemidji State and Ferris State. They do have a non-conference win over Minnesota, but were swept by St. Cloud State. They are in prime position to win the CCHA once again, but will likely need to sweep, or at minimum split with, Michigan Tech to be in a good position going into the conference tournament. 


#**ECAC**  
The Ivies taking a year off continues to hurt the ECAC's strength as a conference, as only Cornell and Harvard have recovered to compete nationally. Quinnipiac, however, has dominated the conference, dropping only two games and one in non-conference to Maine and is in position to get a one seed. The Bobcats are ECAC's only lock, but they do have two other teams in contention for bids.  

**Locks:** Quinnipiac
**Should Be In:** Cornell, Harvard  

**Cornell (16-7-2, PWR: 10, At Large Odds: 72%):** The Big Red have been very good in ECAC play, but played a relatively weak non-conference schedule, though they could not have predicted Minnesota-Duluth being so average this season (they did get swept by the Bulldogs, however). They have clinched a first round bye in the ECAC tournament, thus avoiding the risk of a loss to a very bad team. Finishing the regular season undefeated (home against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, away at Brown and Yale) would go a long way, and is entirely doable.  

**Harvard (17-6-1, PWR: 11, At Large Odds: 67%):** The Crimson have their eye on a Beanpot title tonight against Northeastern, but are also in good shape for their second straight NCAA appearance. Like Cornell, they don't face any of the big dogs in the ECAC down the stretch, but losing a couple could drop Harvard from relatively safe to in danger. For now, they have a good shot of making the field.  

 
#**Hockey East:**   
Hockey East once had six teams in the projected field in the middle of December, but is now down to only two if the tournament started today. It's been a collapse that basically nobody saw coming, and saw UMass and Merrimack fall from the top 10 and top 3, respectively, to off the bubble entirely. It's still slightly possible for Merrimack, Providence, and UMass-Lowell to make the field, but their play lately does not garner any confidence that they will do so and so are not included.

**Should Be In:** Boston University   
**Work To Do:** Northeastern, UConn

**Boston University (20-7, PWR: 4, At Large Odds 61%):** The Terriers non-conference slate boasts wins over Michigan, Notre Dame, Harvard, and Cornell, and they have won 7 in a row in HEA play, but they just have too many games remaining to be a lock. BU will more than likely be in the field come Selection Saturday. This weekend's series against Merrimack could seal the deal.  

**Northeastern (14-10-4, PWR: 15, At Large Odds: 23%):** Northeastern has been good in Hockey East play, but a terrible performance in non-conference, including losses to Union, Sacred Heart, and Bentley, keep them on the edge of the tournament field. The only likely tournament team they will play down the stretch of the regular season is Harvard tonight in the Beanpot final. A win would do a great deal for their bubble hopes.  

**UConn (17-10-3, PWR: 18, At Large Odds: 14%):** One of the early darlings of the season, UConn has since fallen off a cliff. Getting swept by New Hampshire this past weekend did not help at all. The Huskies don't have any team with more than 11 wins left on their schedule and so will need to win out and pick up at least one conference tournament win to make the field.  


#**NCHC**  
The nation's best conference for the past few years is having a down year, but will have at least three, if not four bids to the tournament. Both North Dakota and Minnesota-Duluth are off the bubble for the first time in years, though Western Michigan's resurgence has somewhat made up for it.   

**Should Be In:** Denver, St. Cloud State, Western Michigan  
**Work to Do:** Nebraska-Omaha  

**Denver (23-7-0, PWR: 5, At Large Odds: 65%):** The reigning national champions are cruising in NCHC play, having been swept only once, and currently holding an eight point lead. A relatively tough non-conference schedule has the Pios in a very good position, just outside the one seeds as things stand. A series at Western Michigan in a couple weeks will likely determine if Denver is a lock or not going into the NCHC tournament.  

**St. Cloud State (18-8-2, PWR: 7, At Large Odds: 75%):** St. Cloud was great in non-conference play, but have dropped some NCHC games they shouldn't have, including to Miami and Colorado College. The Huskies finish with three series against the middle of the conference.  

**Western Michigan (19-10-1, PWR: 8, At Large Odds: 76%):** WMU boasts the most productive forward line in college hockey, which includes Hobey Baker favorite Jason Polin. A loss to Alaska-Anchorage isn't great for the resume, but they have enough NCHC wins to be safely in the field right now.  

**Nebraska-Omaha (15-10-3, PWR: 17, At Large Odds: 27%):** Omaha is used to being on the bubble in recent series and they find themselves in the thick of it again this year. They have a sweep of Western Michigan on the resume and an upcoming series against St. Cloud State that could really help their chances. Getting swept by Niagara on opening weekend is not great.  


#**Independents**
Its fairly rare that an independent has a shot at a bid, but there is one team that has one this year.  

**Work To Do:** Alaska  

**Alaska (16-10-2, PWR: 19, At Large Odds: 11%):** The Nanooks have a terrible SOS, but splits with Denver, Notre Dame, and Michigan Tech have given them a shot of making the field for only the third time ever and first since 2010. They will have to win out against Long Island, Arizona State, and Lindenwood after dropping a game to LIU this past weekend, but it is possible.","collegehockey",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/collegehockey/comments/111mb1i/bubble_watch/"

I have been having a hard time and ended up using a lot of the mental health resources MSU has provided. I was very nervous about using them, not knowing what to expect with each, so I thought Id share my experiences with them here. I figure if writing this helps one other Spartan, its worth it. Everything Ive used and more can be found at [https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/)

Grouped by degree of interaction, since that was the hardest part for me, then ranked within each group by order of helpfulness to me personally (YMMV):

**1. No interaction**

* Short Webpage: [Managing Your Distress After a Tragic Event](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/distress_students/index.html)
   * **10/10 start here**. **If you do nothing else, give this a read.**
* [Spartan Resilience Training Program Reflect and Connect Sessions](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/reflect_connect_feb13.html)
   * Cannot recommend signing up for one of these sessions enough. Extremely helpful.
   * You do not have to turn on your camera and there are no breakout rooms. You can participate in the Zoom chat as much or as little as you'd like.
   * For MSU faculty, staff and graduate students - focus is on normalizing the range of reactions right now, and how to help yourself so that you can be there for your students, supervisees, etc.
   * You need to sign up for a session to get the Zoom link.
* Online recording of MSU Webinar: [Developing Resilience in the Wake of Tragedy](https://vimeo.com/799997473/226de731e9)
   * I found it helpful for basic starting information on what is normal to be experiencing right now, answers to the immediate what do I do questions, and an idea of how to start moving forward. Theres also a Q &amp; A at the end with student questions, and it was reassuring to hear other Spartans ask about difficulties Im having as well.
   * CW: Some of the student questions at the end briefly mention where they were on campus and their experience.
* [Uwill Self-Guided Tutorial Videos](https://app.uwill.com/)
   * Free if you sign up with your MSU email
   * Short guided meditation, breathing exercise, and yoga videos.
   * Nothing specific to trauma, but potentially helpful for relaxation and sleep.
   * ADHD gang and anyone else struggling with slowness/stillness right now may find moving meditation more helpful, which isnt on here.

**2. Text-only interaction (anonymous &amp; available 24/7)**

* [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline)
   * You text with a trained counselor about how youre feeling and whatever difficulties or concerns youre having. Like a normal text conversation, it takes them a few minutes to reply sometimes, and it doesnt feel as personal as talking to someone on the phone or IRL.
   * They consider mass shootings a type of disaster and so the counselors refer to last week as a disaster which felt a little odd at first, but otherwise it was helpful to me, particularly for talking about survivors guilt, nightmares, and that sort of thing.
   * They noticeably use some pre-generated messages where they fit, but this isnt because the counselor youre chatting with is disingenuous, just that there are a limited number of volunteers, so they save time by having frequently repeated messages handy to copy and paste. If anything, it means a lot of other people have needed to know/hear the same thing, which is reassuring in its own way.
* [988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/)
   * While suicide is in the name, this service is for anyone in emotional distress.
   * You text with a trained crisis counselor about how youre feeling. They listen, reassure, and help you figure out what you can do to feel a little bit better in the moment. The goal of the conversation is to get you out of that feeling of acute distress, so felt most helpful to text when I was feeling awful, like after a vivid nightmare.
   * At the start of the chat, they ask you to rank how distressed you are and if youre having thoughts of ending your life. If youre not in imminent danger, you may wait a bit to be connected with a counselor.
   * This one was hit or miss for me. Ive used it twice now, and one person I spoke with was incredibly kind and helpful, like talking to a wise older sibling that really cares. The other felt much less authentic, and I didnt find particularly helpful.
* There are a lot of other text helplines, I just havent tried them. [You can find a list on this page if you scroll down and click ""Text, Phone and Hotline Resources""](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/index.html)

**3. Zoom interaction**

* [Finding a long term therapist on ThrivingCampus](https://msu.thrivingcampus.com)
   * **The most helpful thing for me has been finding a therapist to work with via ThrivingCampus.** I saw them on Zoom, but some therapists offer IRL appointments as well (says on their profiles).
   * Lets you filter by identity, practice area, insurance, types of issues they work with, and other factors. If you select available for crisis response in the filtering sidebar on the left, youll only get therapists who have specifically signed up to be available in the aftermath of incidents like this.
   * Pros: I was able to find someone to start seeing that week from the same fairly small identity group as me. The sessions are about an hour long (exact length depends on the therapist and your insurance), which allowed a lot more time to get into things vs just skim the surface.
   * Cons: It is normal therapy like if you found them on Google, so while the website to find them is free, the sessions cost money. How much will depend on your insurance. There is a section at the top left to filter by therapists offering limited free sessions, but I did not try that and don't know how it works.
* [Uwill 1-on-1 teletherapy](https://app.uwill.com/)
   * Free 30 min Zoom session with a licensed therapist - just need to sign up with your MSU email.
   * Pros: you get to pick the therapist. The one I spoke with was an MSU alum and very nice.
   * Cons: 30 min goes by quickly. It helps to make a list ahead of time if there are questions or topics you want to make sure to get to.
   * After your first session, you have the option to schedule more free Zoom sessions, or you can do them on the phone, via text, or by email. Personally, Ive found being able to send an email to the therapist I spoke with really helpful just to have someone Im not as worried about judging me to tell how a tough day went and get some support and suggestions. They reply within 24 hours.

2023-02-07,1675733096,"As a staff employee at MSU, it seems the university has designed it to be irrational to do your job","I am a staff member at MSU. No matter how I look at it, it is not rational to do your job well at this institution. Let me explain why:

Say that person 1 does their job well. Doesnt matter what that is: Reply to an email quickly. Send helpful information to a student. Write a strong report and submit it on time. Take professional development courses and implement what youve learned to improve your office. Join a committee and play a helpful role. Etc.

Heres the first thing that happens next: People see you doing something well (or even doing it at all), and so they go to you for those tasks when they need them again. Other people see that, and they go to you, too. You quickly become very busy, because people increasingly come to you with tasks.

Heres the next thing that happens. Inevitably people ask you to do things outside of your job. In some cases, this is your supervisor, so you often cant say no. But if you do them, eventually people start to view these as your responsibilities. 

Ive been at MSU a few years. Good work has only ever been rewarded with *more work*. All of the people I've seen perform well in their jobs have ended up with responsibilities added on that go far beyond their position. 

Now, consider the alternative, person 2: They dont do some job well. It could be anything: They dont reply to an email. They avoid students or give less than helpful replies. They submit reports late or do them poorly. They are a lackluster committee member. Etc.

Heres the first thing that happens next: People dont ask them to do those things anymore. (They ask person 1 instead, who did them well.) What also happens is that person 2 is not asked to do new things, or if they are and they do them not so well, they arent asked to again in the future. 

Person 1 is overworked, unrewarded, and often the target of blame (because people around them associate them with all the tasks they are now responsible for  and if they arent done, well, who else has ever done them?). Person 2 has free time and lower responsibilities. The bar for decent work is set far lower for them as well.

You might immediately think, ok, but person 2 is eventually going to face consequences  maybe even lose their job, right? In my experience, absolutely not. In fact, the opposite happens to person 2. They have more free time at work, so they use that time to get ahead on some things that are beneficial to them. They use that time to apply to other jobs eventually, too, and sometimes get those jobs or promotions. They fail upwards, and theres a lot of it.

In my opinion, this dynamic is rampant at MSU. You might call it a free rider problem, but it isnt just about individuals, but also the institution. Particularly with staff, good work isnt rewarded, but punished with more work  while not doing your job is rewarded with less work and more free time.

2023-02-15,1676495209,"Black Amerexiter looking for all your advice and help!","Hi Everyone,

Well, I guess I'm finally making a post here. I've been lurking this subreddit for perhaps 2 months now, and I think it's about time I made my own thread for help and advice. To start, I am 34 years old, black, and have been considering leaving the U.S. I first thought about it last year. The Buffalo massacre really got to me -- I almost didn't go to my own graduation because of it. I was so infuriated, as some of the victims could have been my own mother. Now we have what happened at MSU. There is something seriously wrong with our culture (I think it's one of hatred), and sometimes I wonder if it's just me going crazy. Am I consuming too much media? I do not think it is going to get better.

I live in a non-diverse college town on the east coast that houses a PWI. The other day, I visited a local bar and was speaking with an acquaintance (older white guy) that grew up during a time when things were still segregated. I mentioned during our conversation that I didn't grow up in a white neighborhood, and didn't really interact with white students until middle school (my middle school was pretty diverse). He then goes ""Did you get smarter then?"" You know, because the only way black people are intelligent is if they hang around white people (/s). 

That guy's thinking is the same kind of hatred that permeates American society and fuels this country's division. There are people that think just like him that hold positions of power that seriously affect people's lives. What kind of society do you expect to have with people in positions of power that have that level of bias? I digress -- that's not what this thread is about, but I wanted to provide some context for why I am making this thread and considering leaving. Obviously, I want out. The USA isn't the only country in the world. There has to be place where I'm seen as a human first, and not ""black"" or ""black guy"" before anything else. I have traveled outside of the country before, but I have never *lived* in another country. I have been to London, Toronto, Japan, and Aruba by myself.

My field/background is education (most recently edtech) and I have almost a decade of experience in teaching. I've taught in K-8 public education (primarily upper elementary and 6th grade math), and my most recent teaching experience has been teaching (adjuncting) math content courses for education majors/preservice teachers at this university. I have a PhD in education with a specialization in mathematics education from a pretty good university here. I graduated last year.

However, I've been really struggling to find a job and I have student loan debt. I had a job that wasn't the right one for me last year, and I left it in November after working there for 10 months. People will say it's a dumb decision to do so, but I wasn't doing what I was hired to do, more work was getting added onto my plate without a bump in salary, and the company had no long-term plan or goals. They were totally winging it. I was also heavily micromanaged. I've been struggling to find a job since, and getting rejected for jobs I am definitely qualified to do. Other than student loan debt, I don't have any other obligations. I don't have any kids, no wife/not married, and I do not own a home. 

I do not think or know if any of this matters, but most people would describe me as friendly. I like to play the ukulele and guitar, video games, and am very good at cooking. I'm an introvert at my core but also a bit of an ambivert. I love to socialize with others and learn from others' experiences.

Is there anyone that can help in terms of the following:

* Countries that I might want to look into and consider moving to? EU? Asia? Any places that might interest me? I am willing to learn a new language. In fact, that fascinates me.
* Any resources that can help me get started? I'm primarily concerned about employment and work/life balance, retirement, culture, citizenship, etc.?
* Should I pay off my student loan debt here first before moving? I assume this is a good idea but I honestly don't know.

While I graduated from EMU(BA) and UMich(MA), I consider myself a proud Spartan and I love that I can contribute to this university in any capacity. My brother is a junior political science major, and most of his classes were in Berkey.  I'm struggling to find the right words to quantify how I feel in this moment. I am angry, sad, grieving for the students we lost, and hoping the students in the hospital are able to recover. I know one has moved to stable condition, which warms my heart for them. I was not able to be on campus that day, and my thoughts are with my colleagues and each and every student who took action in such a terrifying moment.

I am extremely thankful that my brother wasn't in class that day, but the thought that he could have been taken away from me so soon breaks my heart. I mourn for Brian, Alexandria, and Arielle. I did not know them, but I remember being an undergraduate student burning with motivation to do good in the world, and I weep that they were taken so soon. They had so much more to give to the world. 

 The shockwaves from this horrific event reverberate throughout the entire MSU community, and affect us all in unique ways. While we all work to heal from this tragedy, it is important that we are here for each other.

For some reason, yesterday, last minute, I decided to go home around 6 and spend Valentines Day with my family since I dont have class on Tuesday.  Then, of course, everything happened.

I dont know why Im saying all of this, I just think I needed to get it out to people who might understand.  Every moment Im not crying or shut down, Im guilty for not grieving for my community.  Every time I am grieving for those lost, I feel guilty because I never even knew them.

Than she fled to the Western Thailand, near the border with Myanmar (Burma) before giving herself up to the Thai police.  She was near the Myanmar border because she was wanting to flee Thailand to escape arrest.

This is where it gets interesting...  The Thai police caught her and gave a big press conference with a high ranking police officer.  They told her side of the story (she claims she thought she hit a deer and was in shock) and the police told the public, **they were not going to arrest her** (Even though the US has requested she be extradited back to the US.  The US and Thailand have an extradition treaty).  The police said she was willing to return to the United States and that **she would be on a plane before Sunday, 19 February.**  They said Ms Howson returning to the US on her own free will would be an example of the high morality of the Thai people.  Nonsense!  Thailand is more concerned about it's image as a tourist destination (with moral people) than in justice in the US.

Here it is evening, Tuesday, 21 February 2023 in Thailand and **Mrs. Howson still has not gotten on a plane**.  She seems to be free in Thailand and responsible for her own timeline as to when she will turn herself in (if ever).  There is still the possibility that she escapes Thailand to a neighboring country (that does not have an extradition treaty).  Thai police is notoriously corrupt.  It would not be difficult to bribe the police to gain her freedom.

This is very disturbing.

The Oakland County Sheriff who has been giving reports on this case is Michael J. Bouchard.  He has given interviews with the press prior to Mrs. Howson being found in Thailand.  **The public needs to have a status update from the police department.**  This whole case seems to be falling apart, but there are no reports in the American or Thai press.  It looks as though Mrs. Howson is getting away.  She will not return on her own unless she is pressured to do so.  **If the public remains quiet, the Thai police will do nothing and Mrs. Howson will get away with killing Benjamin Kable.**

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially  in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous  back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to  offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.

Some  people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week  between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.

I  watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw  in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on  each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in  this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped  themselves, at the end.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State

While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.

I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.

Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane

Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.

Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.

More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.

Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State

Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.

While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.

In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty

Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.

The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.

Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford

This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.

There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.

Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State

These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.

Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.

During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State

Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.

When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.

However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland

I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.

Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.

With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA

I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.

We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.

I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota

Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.

Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.

During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State

I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.

The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.

Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia

This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.

After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.

Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin

Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.

Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.

In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee

A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.

And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.

In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State

While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.

After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.

On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina

A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

2023-02-21,1677014019,"My Sister was Forced to Return to Campus and Take a Midterm Today","Title says it all. The professor was not willing to push the midterm back to next week or offer to put the questions online for students to take. Anyone who didnt show up received a 0. Am I crazy for thinking this is insane?? One of the students my sister has for group work told her that her best friend is in the hospital on her death bed from being shot last week, and she left her side to go take an exam. 

I understand there is a credit / no credit option. Does anyone else feel this isnt enough? My sister is a junior and has As in her classes, so she really doesnt want to do credit / no credit. I feel at a minimum students shouldve had an extra week to heal. Professors had a week to make PowerPoints and record lectures, so why wasnt posting material online required by the university until at least after spring break? 

My sister is traumatized. She was across the street from the union when shots rang out and ran home to her off campus house to take cover. She knew the girl Alex who passed away. One week is NOT enough time to heal! Many people cant return back to a place of trauma without it impacting their mental health more, especially one week later! Im so disappointed in MSU and any faculty that are pushing for business as usual. Nothing about this is normal!!! 

This post isnt to downplay the actions the university has taken. Individuals coming together to support each other (like Spartan Sunday) is amazing. But that wasnt the university who came up with the idea. The only solutions offered so far were more police on campus and credit/no credit. I just feel like this isnt enough, and want to know if others feel the same, especially family members of survivors.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season

**Team: New England Patriots**  
Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  
Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18

Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.

Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.

This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.

Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story

Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 

The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 

This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.

Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 

Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs. 

***

#Three Quick Questions

**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**

The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.

**What the hell happened with the coaches?**

All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  
&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him

This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.

The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 

So why Patricia? Well, he was available.

**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**

Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 

Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers

Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.

**Three cheers for...**  
*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*

These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.

You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.

**Three jeers for...**  
*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*

Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.

And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  

The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.

##Highlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 

**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.

##Lowlights  

**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 

**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.

**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 

Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*

##2022 NFL Draft Recap

**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**

**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.

**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**

**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**

**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.

**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**

**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete

**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete


The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward. 

**2022 draft grade-right now (B+)**
***
#2022 Free Agent Review  

##Notable Additions

**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.

**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.

**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.

**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.


##Departures

**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.

**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.

**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.

**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.

**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.

**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.

**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)

Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.

Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.

*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

**QUARTERBACKS**

|QBR|56.9|36.2|34.5|
|Passer Rating|92.5|84.8|100.9|


Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 

Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  


I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)


In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 


Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles.

Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.


In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.


All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 

While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  
*Written by ecupatsfan12*  

##Roster Review  
Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.

##Quarterbacks

**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  

Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.

Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.
***
##Running Backs

**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.

**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.

**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.

**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.

**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.

**Damien Harris** UFA
***
##Wide Receivers

**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.

**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.

**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.

**Nelson Agholor** UFA

**Jakobi Meyers** UFA

**Matthew Slater** Re-signed

**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.

**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.

**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.

**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.

**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.

*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.
***
##Tight Ends

**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.

**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.

**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.

*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.
***
##Offensive Line

**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.

**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.

**James Ferentz** UFA

**Yodny Cajuste** RFA

**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.

**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.

**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.

**Marcus Cannon** UFA

*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).

**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.

Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 
***
##Defensive Line 

**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.

**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.

**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.

**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.

**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.
***
##Defensive Ends

**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.

**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.

**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.

*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)
***
##Linebackers and Defensive backs

Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.

Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

Here what I have in mind are straightforward dollars and cents losses that abusive families inflict on themselves because they want to maintain the illusion that they are always right and we couldn't possibly have useful feedback.

Two examples from my own life follow. Feel free to add your own.

----

Back when I was a college student, Mother told me her parents were buying a time share. I'd seen consumer warnings about time share investments and cautioned her, ready to supply references. She brushed that off with, ""They're getting a good one.""

[Morgan Freeman voice: ""They did not get a good one.""]

----

Before that while I was in high school, had been reading up on economics and found out about Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, back when that was open to new investors. Mentioned that to her and suggested she look into it. She never took the idea seriously.

----

Years before that while I was a kid, pulling weeds in Mother's yard was my chore. Maybe there's a separate conversation about whether it's age appropriate to task an eight-year-old with the entire responsibility for weed control in a suburban yard. Setting that aside, one day I noticed a strange weed. It looked like a sandspur but wasn't as sharp. 

So I stepped indoors to report it to Mom and asked her to have a look. She barely looked up from her book as she gave the brush-off.

This, I didn't learn until many years later, was the start of the yellow nutsedge infestation. Nutsedge is one of the worst weeds that can infest a yard, because a nutsedge weed a few inches tall can send down roots and tubers [nearly three feet deep in the soil](https://www.canr.msu.edu/weeds/extension/yellow-nutsedge). The tubers are the size of a raisin--not easy to find. Herbicides that kill the plant don't kill the tuber. So once nutsedge gets established, landscapers are known to deal with it by digging up and replacing several feet of topsoil.

Mother was always thinking about resalability of her house: she refused to paint the walls any color than white and she refused to install wall mounted shelving because those changes might make the house harder to sell. Meanwhile during the next twenty years nutsedge took over her yard. Any intelligent buyer would reduce the offer by the cost of a major landscaping project if they made an offer at all.

It wouldn't be surprising if she let the whole thing get so bad just because I'm the one who first pulled up a nutsedge to show her and suggested it might be a problem.

Folks,

We all know that the 2A is currently under a massive attack (great band, btw) in the state of Michigan, and right now, it is absolutely critical that lawmakers and the general public hear our voices. That being said, the amount of traction I've seen to try and counter these efforts has been minimal. GLGR has said they will file motion for recall elections for anyone who votes yes which is a solid response, but we need to turn out in mass to voice our disapproval of these bills in the first place.

I've also seen a few attempts at organizing an actual protest that have not produced any fruit as of yet. To that end, I'm going to take it upon myself to organize a peaceful protest and follow through with it.

Therefore, in the same manner that the MSU students did a short while ago,  I propose that gun owners stage a similar demonstration on **Saturday, March 11th at 12:00pm** at the state capitol, a la what happened in Virginia to actual success.

If you decide to come to this event, please observe these simple guidelines, as we need to present ourselves properly:

* Do not engage in any form of violence or harassment of others, especially if they don't agree with our position.
* If carrying, please be smart, sensible, and follow all applicable laws.
* Please dress appropriately. Business casual is fine. Political garb from either side just weakens our message (that message being that the 2A is for everyone; leave the ""Unite for a better future"" shirts or ""MAGA"" hats at home.)
* Do not engage in conversation with journalists. If you are asked questions by the media, your response should go along the lines of ""I am a concerned citizen who has shown up to defend my rights. All partisan actions or items here are not in association with what is being protested, and I do not affiliate myself with any political ideologies being raised here, and have no further comment.""
* Do not engage in political discussion that is off-topic (**anything** not related to the 2A)
* Do not discuss fringe issues (Covid, election fraud, etc.)
* Do not bring signs or imagery that can be used to paint 2A supporters in a negative light. Including but not limited to, Confederate flags, swastikas, punisher skulls, pirate flags,  encouraging violence etc.
* Invariably, bad actors will most likely be present. If you are asked about any of these issues, say something to the effect of: ""This peaceful protest is in support of Michigan citizens second  amendment rights and that is all. All partisan actions or items here are not in association with what is being protested, and I do not affiliate myself with any political ideologies being raised here.""
* Do not obstruct traffic. The plaza in front of, and sidewalks around the capitol building are legally protected protest areas in the state of Michigan. Obstructing traffic is illegal. To that end, do not engage in any unlawful behavior at all.
* Discourage anyone from engaging in any of the above prohibited behavior

We need to make our voices heard, and we absolutely need to support the GLGR if and when it comes to recall elections to get these dangerous legislators away from our rights.

2023-02-22,1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 

\-Going back to work.

The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 

\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.

From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 

\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.

In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 

However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.

The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 

This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.

\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest

With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 

Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 

I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 

I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works.

**Why Bork'An?** \- Bork""An offers up what I consider the most toolbox kit of the overall Tau Septs that gives ultimate flexibility. Additional durability from mid to light arms fire, additional 4"" range, and ignoring invuls every now and then is massively clutch when you just need something to happen.

**HQ Slots**

Coldstar Commander - Pretty straightforward Precision of the Hunter with some personal modifications. High Output Burst, Thermonuetronic Projector, and Fusion. I generally save my 2CP experimental weaponry stratagem for the fusion on this guy, as PotH makes it much more reliable to get that ignore invul fusion through, mainly to assassinate characters. Onager gauntlet shreds heavy infantry thats so common in the meta and gives another phase to interact in. 

Ethereal - Probably the most straight line power of the list. Humble stave for 2 invocations of FnP 5+++ and extra CP every turn. Exemplar of Mont'Ka goes here so I can fire and forget my Commander if needed and the Crisis don't lose re-rolls to wound. 

**Troops Slot**

Kroot **-** They do kroot things, could you ask for anything more? Generally standing on points and doing infantry based secondaries or tertiaries. 

Breachers - I almost always strategic reserve these bad boys. Bork'An lets them get a 12"" range on their close tier band of guns, allowing them to obliterate shit from strategic and Breach &amp; Clear with a markerlight setup. 

**Elites Slots**

XV8 Crisis Suits - 5x Plasma, 5x Cyclic, 5x Burst. Extremely Versatile platform allowing you to always have good targets and decent range with 22"" on the shorter range guns. Gets to advance 18"" and shoot, use Dynamic Offensive on them as needed with the 2nd CP from the Ethereal. I pack a shit ton of drones so that unit is an absolute bitch to chew through. Stimm Injectors because it's such a clutch hotfix to being in a bad situation. 

Firesight Marksman - I always want to take this unit out of my army, but every weekend Im reminded how useful this model is. They basically never die because of character protection and the stealth field. Deploy her in a piece of terrain that can see 2-3 objectives and you can leave her there all game, lighting things up for 3-4 turns with Ohrtus Lantern and redeploys with Exemplar of Kauyon.

**Fast Attack**

Kroot Hounds - Ol' Reliable for move blocking, snagging objectives, and keeping those pesky world eaters at bay turn 1. You want to be running minimum 3x4's

Vespids - These dudes are insane for their 12ppm price tag. Their guns alone pickup twice their value in game. Deep strike ability is premium and they move 14""! Great units for Retrieve Battlefield Data and dish out a punch in a pinch. 

Tetras - Mobile markerlights on demand. They move 18"" so stick them in a central location and you'll always have markerlights when you need them. People avoid shooting them because they don't murder you themselves. 

**Heavy Support**

Hammerhead - Does hammerhead things. Try not to cry when you roll a 1 to wound and you have no CP.

Skyray - Deceptively high damage with markerlight utility. 22"" accelerator burst cannons pack some dakka, and 1Cp for frequency lock lets the Array shoot D3+1 seekers out of LoS. This thing has crazy base stats for 135pt base and 10 for accelerators.

Broadsides - a Controversial unit for many, but I find them to be my reliable firebase. No one wants to shoot them because they're tough as hell in cover so I find them surviving most games. Set them in a spot that can see 2-3 objectives and hurl smart missiles and railguns their way. Multi-Tracker upgrade lets the smart missiles makeup for the -1 to hit out of LoS and nukes small infantry like gaurd, cultists, or orks. Also multi tracker railguns into large units of Custodes is just big LuL's.  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Secondaries**

This is probably the most important part of your gameplan and will vary on your mileage at events because Tau are stuck always taking 1 kill secondary. 

1. Decisive Action - a must take. Engage on all Fronts is inferior in every way and behind Enemy Lines takes a lot of commitment but can be screened out. I take this in 100% of my games
2. Banners, Retrieve Battlefield Data, or Aerospace Targeting Relays - Entirely dependent on matchup/mission. If you know you're going to have a non-interactive game or you're going to take a frontline assault Retrieve Battlefield Data is the way. 6 Objective missions like Tide of Conviction, Recover the Relics I take banners, and if I know I can achieve (2) 1st turn Aerospace markers and kill most of my opponent's army by turn 5 I will take Aerospace. Breaks. 
   1. An important note about Aerospace is that you start the action within 6"", don't have to end there. So if you start the action and string a unit along behind terrain, if they don't overkill you the unit will still complete it. 
3. The dreaded kill secondary - the most risky of all the options. Tau suffer from having to take one, so use your best judgement. Abhor the witch for Tsons and GK, Bring it down into Knights, Assasination for sisters and character heavy lists, no prisoners for heavy wounds, and grind for MSU. Be wary of grind if you know they can kill you too.   


**Mont'Ka or Kauyon?**

Kauyon is generally the better of the two, but part of being a good commander is recognizing when Mont'Ka is appropriate for when you can capitalize on an early game edge. I take Mont'Ka every 1 of 4 or 5 games. The math on Kauyon is insane, and you should be aiming to trade primary points or keep your opponent at 8's or ideally 4's on turns 1 and 2. Stage your army for turn 3  Kauyon, and start pressing the attack. 

Mont'Ka gameplay is to punish deployment mistakes and getting first turn, or if you know you wont survive until turn 3. I commonly take it into aggressive Ork players because the reroll 1s to wound and being able to get into position immediately with advancing and shooting the entire army means you can meet the DPS check aggressive Ork builds tend to dish out. 

**Other Things**

I saw a few questions in some threads last week that I can answer about my list. 

1. Why do you bring so many markerlights, it seems you cant even use them all? - Better to have 20 markerlight shots a turn than only have what you need. The Tetras are light vehicles and having so many means I can always have them without necessarily risking being out of position. Also not the first time my Tetra will roll triple 2's
2. 3x Broadsides, what? - Controversial unit these day it seems. I see that a lot of folks yeet shit into the broadsides turn 1 or underestimate how tough they are at 8 wounds with a 1+ in cover. The single shield drone in the unit means it's off putting to immediately shoot anti tank guns into them. That drone usually dies to savior protocols. Multi-tracker has been a uniquely useful piece of equipment. Combined with SMS it launches the lath into hilarious territory when Kauyon kicks in to killing chaff. If you can sit them in one spot and zone a few objectives all game, they are doing their job. You want them to make the tough choice of deciding to stand on an objective and get hit with Railguns, or dont. 
3. Onager Gauntlet Commander - Phase versatility is king in this game and movement wins games. The ability to delete a unit of like (3) 8-Bound in combat is an unparalleled high and is clutch for being able to free up shooting somewhere else. This commander gets absolute work done on units with no invul in combat and punking tanks in combat when shooting doesnt get the job done.

2023-02-07,1675779468,"The Reddit Guide to MSU (warning: its pretty long (TWSS))","Ive seen a lot of people on this sub ask the same questions a lot. I figured, being a senior, I would do my part for the next generation of Spartans. Here is my list of things to help you succeed at MSU as a freshman, transfer, or alumni. Hope you enjoy:

Rule 1: it is strongly encouraged that a refresher driving course is taken before your time at MSU. The drivers here are world class and the course would help others to stay safe. Im sending a personal invitation to the girl driving her Mercedes in the STEM parking lot who looked right (and only right) while trying to make a right hand turn whilst finding a parking spot. Not a care in the world for anyone else driving that day. 

Rule 2: if you park somewhere you arent supposed to, or dont pay when required (no matter your feelings on the subject), and get in trouble via fine/towing& thats on you big dogs, not the towing company, not MSU, not the lord almighty Reggie Christ. 

Rule 3: Possibly the second most important rule on the list (see final rule for most important), ASK YOUR ADVISOR. Not Payton Thorne, not Tom Izzo, not your cousin Cletus&YOUR ADVISOR. It may be hard to believe but your advisor is there to give you advice on the many rigors of college, and if they dont know the answer, youre SOL. When in doubt about any concern, question, etc&ASK YOUR ADVISOR.

Rule 4: Going along with rule 4 is cut out the middle man. If you have a financial aid question, contact the financial aid office. Grade question? Office of the Registrar! Its amazing what we can accomplish when we logically ask the correct people for certain things.

Rule 5: Freshman: I promise you no one cares about you showing off your parents money except the jealous girls (if youre a girl) in your sorority. Dress like a bum like the rest of us, we all hate it here as it is we dont need you to make us more miserable.

Rule 6: no matter how confident your are, your pullout game is not that good. Wear a jimmy my boy. College is cheaper than a child, keep it that way. 

Rule 7: dont be a dick head to the people who help you around campus (or even off campus). The food staff (not limited to) is literally feeding you, be respectful of their time and effort.

Rule 8: Freshman: the campus is overall safe. There are a few tips and tricks to making it safer for you and your friend group: be a male, be white. Once you master these two things youre set! 

Rule 9: MSU (and all colleges really) are not the best for reporting cases of sexual assault. The sexual assault healthcare program is truly a great place and for anyone who has had this happen to them and can help you to make the best decision for you. Girls: dont be afraid to speak up. You dont have to go through that alone.

Rule 10: Trust me in this one&dont expect to walk from Lot 89 to the main areas of campus. You will be eaten by squirrels or ran over by a train if you try.

Rule 11: enjoy your time here. Meet new people, but never let your guard down. There  are sadly many sick people in this world (including your peers) who will walk all over you if given the chance. Dont give them the chance.

Rule 12: one thing I learned quickly in my 6 years of college is very rarely should you listen to the opinions of others when it comes to who is a bad (most likely the adjective horrible or terrible are used) professor. Most times the people who say they had a bad experience are the ones who are not applying themselves in class, or who think this is high school and their prof told them no to raising their 89.4 to a 90 when it clearly states no rounding in the syllabus.

Rule 14: before you ask your professor a silly ass question, READ THE SYLLABUS. 99.99% of the time the answer you seek is in there. To go along with this, never start an email/conversation with I know it say *blank* in the syllabus, but& Just FYI it says *blank* in the syllabus for a reason, so dont ask.

Rule 15: if youre sick, stay home. College is already  a cesspool of disease and illness, dont bring your known germs into the classroom and get everyone sick. Communicate with your professors and 7-8/10 times they wont care that you missed class. To go with this (and anyone familiar with puke girl on the 2023 snap story), if youre constantly sick please go see a doctor. Listen and be respectful of their time and services even if you have to wait a long time. This is a shot at puke girl (sorry!) but NEVER let your STEM/nursing friends treat you. Just go see a doctor. 

Rule 16: guys, respect the women. Youre not impressing anyone. 

AND FINALLY, for all of the (international) freshman who have a 9.47 GPA, 12795 SAT, started an orphanage for disadvantaged children, cured cancer, and solved world hunger by inventing a self sustaining floating farm&Rule 17: yes youll more than likely get into the honors college.

For anyone that made it this far I hope you enjoyed my list of tips, tricks, and rules. I think this could be a fun thing to keep adding to so feel free to comment your own rules! I think its obvious, but satire and sarcasm are always welcome on this post. Maybe indicate so we dont confuse the freshmen too much :)","msu",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/10w2xjj/the_reddit_guide_to_msu_warning_its_pretty_long/"

Spend less than you earn, put the savings into good investments, get a portfolio of about 25x your annual expenses.  What if I just boiled good health down to a few rules and actually stuck to them too?  I could get better off than 97% of people (made up statistic) and be reaping huge benefits.  Its totally achievable; why not take action?  Thats the tldr.

#Preamble

First up, this is a bit of a long post so Im breaking it into sections so people can jump about to what they want.  Im on a bit of a tangent here but I swear it all ties back to FI so I hope you stick with me.  Secondly, Im just a random person on reddit with no credentials so Im going to be linking out to a whole bunch of sources when making any claims.  You can check them out for yourself.  Thirdly, any advice I give is only my own advice to myself.  So take my advice with a grain assault and if something works a bit differently for you then Id like to hear your take on things too.

#How remarkably similar Health and FI are

Everyone is looking for a quick and easy fix.  People seem to get most of their advice from influencers or advertising rather than sticking to tried and true methods.  Everybody is jumping on fads and hype trains.  The average person is mostly unaware and really not in a great state.  It seems overwhelmingly complicated from the outside.  The government is dropping the ball at helping people with this and corporations are stepping in.  Doing the wrong thing gets you short term pleasure at the cost of long term wellbeing.  Life is more expensive if you dont have it.  The only thing that really works is effort and discipline over a sustained time.  It all boils down to good habits and a few simple rules.  Once you build the habit it basically runs on autopilot.  Gains compound as the years go by. Having it unlocks more potential for you to achieve bigger and better things.

Are the above sentences talking about money or health?  Well, both.  Its amazing to me how much the story is exactly the same between the two spaces for all intensive purposes.  Its a bit of a revelation I had after I hit the boring middle financially and looked to do new things that werent boring.  I sought to own my health the way I owned my money and realized the two had so much in common.  I have no doubt that you, being on /r/financialindependence are fully capable of absolutely owning your health just like youve owned your money.  Its worth it.

Blah blah blah.  Take care of your health: weve heard it a bajillion times for years.  Very boring  But what if I actually did it: really followed the rules?  Like how I actually followed those great personal finance rules (assuming, since youre here).  What if I didnt think those health rules were so out of touch, the same way so many think personal finance rules are out of touch? 

#Why Bother?

Since were on FI, Ill mention: being in good health can save you sooo much money.  I can get FI sooner.  Healthcare is hella expensive.  Insurance is hella expensive.  Your body is truly priceless, so if you do it wrong the bills get insane.  Also, getting healthy is cheap!  Healthy food is cheap (more on this later), exercise is cheap (more on this later), and there is another more powerful and deeper thing that saves the most money of all (suspense!).

Outside of money, its amazing to see how much of a difference is easily possible.  Take a look at the pie chart of causes of premature death in the west. (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)  Its pretty incredible.  Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, respiratory disease.  Right from the gecko you can see like 75% of premature death is related to lifestyle factors.  Now, you could still get unlucky but you have the power to take almost 75% of your tickets in the Death Raffle (starring Jason Statham) off the table.  Something will still get you eventually but you can probably make sure you get 75+ good years!

OK its not all about just being alive, what about quality of life?  Its pretty close to the same.  75ish% of chronic diseases are tied to lifestyle factors and often quite preventable. Why dont we just nip all those chronic diseases and deaths in the butt? You can live longer AND better.  

And thats just talking about avoiding disadvantages.  Im sure you can list a few advantages like looking better, having more energy, being able to conquer greater physical challenges, and being happier.  This was ultimately what I was after: feeling good and the capability to do the activities I want to do for decades to come.

#Well, what are the simple health rules?

This is a bit off the FI topic so skip if you need to. Theres bound to be some controversy here (always is) but I am posting backup sources.  

#1 Get enough sleep
#2 Get enough exercise
#3 Eat good

Details below.

**1  Get at least 8 hours of sleep.**

Primarily, you just have to actually give yourself full amount of time every night.  But if you have trouble with sleep quality there are [a few tips]( https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-habits) to try.

[Why sleep?]( https://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb21759528__Smatthew%20walker%20why%20we%20sleep__Orightresult__U__X2?lang=eng&amp;suite=def) Ever get a cold after an all nighter?  Its not a coincidence.  [Your immune system needs sleep. ](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod2/05.html)  Your immune system also fights cancerous cells and inflammation and respiratory viruses, which it sucks at when you dont sleep.  [Sleep also produces the human growth hormone]( https://www.nulifeinstitute.com/blog/what-is-the-link-between-human-growth-hormone-and-sleep) that lets you turn protein into muscle.  You can eat all the protein and work out all you want but if you dont sleep itll still mostly get turned into fat.  [Sleep is obviously important for the brain too!]( https://www.brainandlife.org/articles/how-sleep-protects-the-brain/)  Energy, memory, cognition, mood (happiness).  I hate to be the bear of bad news but [even if you can power through with caffeine, youre missing out on a ton of benefits by not sleeping enough.]( https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/caffeine-and-sleep)

**2 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes vigorous.  Strength training twice per week, and a bit of stretching.**  (At least) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an6LKlx3JH8) (https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf)

Strong heart, strong bones, strong muscles, good endorphins (happiness), anti-injury, anti-frailty, do more, go farther.  Why does everyone have back pain these days?  Mostly because weak backs and inflexibility sets us up for failure.  

Theres lots of different exercise programs out there, and many of them are pretty good.  P90X, starting strength, pilates, 0-5k, personal trainers, laps in the pool, zumba, spin, lots of good options (and bad ones too, unfortunately).  If you have some specific goals like muscle building, weight loss, six pack abs, Olympic racewalking records, the splits, or becoming alpha, you can tailor things to you.  Just get started because you can't fix your body with duck tape later.  But start with rule #2 as the baseline and you cant go wrong.

**3  Diet: (a) Half your food should be fruit/vegetables (b) carbs should be unrefined (c) lean towards plant proteins.** 
(https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) 
(https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-eating-plate)

These rules work for me.  What does not work for me is tracking food (counting servings, calories, macros, vitamins, minerals, or whatever else.  Its too tedious.) and this is more actionable for me than Mediterraneanness (is this avocado Mediterranean enough?  What about this sushi?). This is the anti-cancer, anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-diabetes, anti-oxidant, anti-inflamatory, anti-hypertension, anti-obesity, anti-tooth decay, high protein, low saturated fat, high vitamin, high mineral, low confusion, low hassle diet for forever.

This is also the scientific consensus.  Your influencer might like keto better but scientists like this.  

Why these food rules?

(a)	You can do a whole lot with just this rule.  It almost speaks for itself.  Practically every vegetable is a superfood in its own right and if superfoods are half your diet you are already killing it.  Vegetables are no contest the best nutrient/calorie out there.  Theyre so filling they make it hard to overeat (thus calorie counting, which is a real pain in the ass, irrelevant) and so nutritious you dont really need to count vitamins by default.

(b)	Carbs are the villain du jour for a while now.  Carbs are fine, good even, yall are just eating the crappy ones.  Sugar and white flour, but [especially sugar]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM&amp;t).  Carbs like oatmeal, quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice, barley, chia  these arent the Carbs youre looking for, Joe Rogan.  High in [fiber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtnTuTX4L24&amp;t), nutrients, more filling, less calories, less boom-bust blood sugar.  So much goodness and lots of energy (you have to fuel Rule #2, remember).  This rule was maybe the trickiest for me, because sugar is hidden in so many foods I thought were healthy (yogurt, granola, cheerios, almond milk, pasta sauce, protein bars, salad (dressing), health drinks, bread, and with the sauces that sneak onto everything).

(c)	Im not saying go vegan.  I am saying cut back on [processed meat (a group 1 carcinogen, the same group as smoking), and red meat (group 2A carcinogen)]( https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat), cheese (like meat, just so much [saturated fat]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwSMgZYAaZU&amp;t)) and add in more lentils, beans, and nuts.  [Lentils]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/172421/nutrients) and [beans]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/747444/nutrients) have more protein per calorie (and per dollar too) than [ground beef]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746779/nutrients) .  [They are just super good for you](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/), vitamins minerals fiber and so on.  There are some hardliners who say veganism is the healthiest diet, some say pesco-vegetarian, some say were all lactose intolerant, nobody can agree about eggs.  The jury/science is still out on a few things but either way the scientific consensus is that the West is eating too much animal products for its own good.


(d)	What? There was no rule (d) listed above.  Well this is a bonus rule.  Rule (d) is that rules were meant to be broken.  Any diet that doesnt let you eat cake on your own birthday is stupid.  If you really fully follow a,b, and c even just like 80% of meals, then your diet is so damn good it basically wont matter if you have some treats on occasion.  This diet is for your whole life, not for yo-yo boom and bust.

You can add or adjust rules to fit your personal goals, but in my opinion this is the baseline to start from.  Less meat, cheese, and sugar - more vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes.  So simple. Its not rocket appliances.  I think its pretty hard to argue with that, but people will.

#But how does this help me be FI?

Numerous ways.  Less medical expenses is obvious.  But you also get more years and healthier years to work (or not work) which gives you bonus time to become more wealthy.  Costs go down AND earning can go up: you are getting two birds stoned at once.

And eating healthy is WAY cheap.  Oatmeal, quinoa, peas, beans, lentils, tomatoes, bananas, apples, squash, carrots, cabbage, brown flour, brown rice, peanuts, potatoes, onions, yams, corn, beets.  All these might be like $1-2 per pound.  A whole days food might be like $5.  Way cheaper than fast and processed food and way healthier too.  People who say healthy food is expensive must not realize you dont need organic, or worse they might be buying ultraprocessed expensive dumb supplements, juices, bars, or shakes that probably have a load of sugar.

Exercise is cheap too.  A pair of runners and a trip to /r/bodyweightfitness can get you going.  Although you might want more, like some basic gear like a /r/homegym or a bike.  Exercise can be way cheaper than some other entertainment sources, like fancy electronics or hitting the bar or shopping on Amazon.  No exaggeration: in some cases, two pints at a pub will cost more than a month gym membership.  Commuting by foot power is way cheaper than a car.  It saves money in the short and long term.

But the real, most profound cost savings that I kept you in suspense about (not really) from the beginning is that good health makes you happy.  [Science shows](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) that good health is a major factor in being happy.  Happy people arent as susceptible to advertising to fill the void in their life.  They dont need consumerist junk.  They dont need to scour amazon for joy or get expensive status symbols for validation.  They dont need to smoke or drink to take the edge off.  They arent cranky because they are tired and low on blood sugar.  Will following my rules make you happy?  No promises but science says it helps.

#How has this worked out for me, so far

Good actually.  Its been more than a year since I starting bringing these rules in and they are autopilot now.  If I eat fast food I actually get a bit of tummy discomfort now, so the rules are truly easier to stick with than not to.

My skin looks better.  I can see a bit of abs showing even though Im not trying for that.  Im looking trim while watching my cohort at work get fat (sorry yall, Id sugar coat it but im following Rule 2b).  Ive made gains with weights and my resting heart rate is down to 54 bpm.  I have pretty good energy levels for an old guy.

And Im saving money like crazy.  My food costs like $60 per week.  I have no health issues to pay for.  I have a  $1,000 home gym which is now free entertainment. And love my surfing and biking and hiking which is also close to free.

And Im happier.  Im so much better at dealing with stress at work.  My body just feels good most of the time, which spills over into my mood and so I just mentally feel good.  I like people more and have been socializing a bit better.  I didnt used to be like this.  I used to be tired and stiff, cranky and stressed.  It's not always perfect but it's better than before.

What else is there to say?  Honestly, I just recommend giving it a shot.

2023-02-15,1676465799,"Why Horny on Main Is Not Inclusive","**Why Horny on Main Is Not Inclusive**

Sigmarxism was put together to be an inclusive space for everyone. It's a library, it's a common area, it's your hopefully unproblematic local gaming club. We want everyone to feel welcome here.

The most common excuse we get for horny on main is that it's about sex positivity and the poster is only trying to complement that person/model/character.

**Sex Positivity**

For those that don't know;

""sex positivity says that sex can be a positive thing in a person's life. More than just that, though, says Texas-based sex educator Goody Howard, sex positivity is the idea that people should have space to embody, explore, and learn about their sexuality and gender without judgment or shame[.](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-positive-meaning#sex-positive-defined)""

We agree that this is a good thing, a necessary thing to undo the damage of puritan or religious attitudes, sexist stigmas that exist in society, and good as a whole for the whole LGB­T­QIA+ community.

**Horny on Main is not the Space for (sexuality)** **Sex Positivity**

Sigmarxism is simply not the space to explore your sexuality. Posting unironic horny, even if it's a variety of horny that goes against 'gender norms', is still objectifying someone or something, and possibly against a person's wishes. Or it's objectifying to someone who does not want to see it. It's off putting to someone who wants to look at minis, it alienates comrades. There have been studies that link the *unsolicited sexual objectification of people to negative mental health*. Sex positivity includes consent. When people joined this subreddit they did not sign up for these posts or comments.

Let's look at some of the comments we see reported and removed CW horny/casual r\*pe mention:

&gt;!\- ""uwu mommy dommy step on me""!&lt;

&gt;!This is reversing traditional gender roles, yet still objectifying her as a sexual object for the posters pleasure.!&lt;

&gt;!\- ""Death by snu snu""!&lt;

&gt;!This is still objectifying a someone as a sexual object.!&lt;

&gt;!\- ""Breeding rights are mine, yes-yes!""!&lt;

&gt;!Still objectifies afab and also casually pro-rape. Even within a context (there wasn't) of consensual or table top RP we don't want these comments here. This subreddit was made because we were tired of this garbage in other places!&lt;

When we remove a post, we're not judging you or your sexuality on a personal level, we're annoyed you're breaking community rules, alienating other posters and repeatedly doing so will end up with a ban.

Before you post, ask yourself if you are objectifying anything, anyone, a group of people, a gender, a race, or a body type with your comments. If you are, then don't post that here to the sub with 30k+ users. If you really really feel like you need your opinion known, maybe you have a tight friend group where that's acceptable, or go to an other appropriate subreddit/twitter/tumblr/dating app for this.

**Gender**

The definition of sex positivity includes gender as part of an individuals exploration and discovery.  On this subreddit we actively encourage any discussion about it with everyone, with engagement with table top settings or lore books, character backstories, character relationships or pride flag painting schemes.

**Nudity**

We have from the beginning allowed models posted that have nudity or semi nudity. It's not an inherent sexual thing to show a nude model.  Comments that engage with western cultural stigmas and sexualize the nudity will be removed. We simply ask that if you post a nude mini you use some discretion; is it only nude or is it in a sexually suggestive pose or has sexualized iconography? If it's the latter, don't post it. Use your judgement and discretion. We require that you use the NSFW tag on nude or semi nude models. Posting something in the title about it is helpful.

**Ironic and funny**

Once in a great while we allow some discussion that parodies some aspect, or riffs on a topic in an ironic way. These are difficult to define in a clear way. An element of satire must be clear. These posts don't punch down. The posts still don't get extremely explicit. Often these mock the extremely unironically horny. These have always been up to community reporting / mod discretion and the posts must be tagged with a NSFW.

As mods, we've seen an uptick in *unironic horny posts* in the last few months. Please, don't confuse the sexuality part of sex positivity with inclusiveness in a main sub. Keep horny posts to appropriate spaces and not here.

2023-02-14,1676383028,"Please give this a read this morning.","Good morning, fellow Spartans.

As my flair suggests, Im an educator and as sad as it is to say, Ive had a lot of training on events like these. In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. Thats not to say Im an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.

What many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.

Address these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.

Try to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear. As they say on airplanes, put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to assist others.

Id love for this thread to remain a place for Spartans to talk through their emotions, share social emotional wellness resources, or to just listen. Whatever you need, remember - your are cared for, your are loved, and you are safe.

Im here if anyone needs anything, and knowing our other mods - theyre likely here for you as well, in whatever capacity they can.

There were literally kids that graduated the high school shooting that happened about 18 months ago, went on to Michigan State, and have now witnessed their second mass school shooting. A MSU senior was also a survivor of Sandy Hook. Second mass shooting in her lifetime.

http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(q103ribhe4hx04gzkxmomykf))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-227

This is a FELONY

He posted a $5,000 bond and the case was ""bound over"" to a different circuit court and ""closed"" on 6/27/2019.

I can find no record of the case in the other circuit and there's nothing to indicate that the bond was ever returned.

Is the case still pending four years later?

Was the case dismissed?  If so, why?

What was the outcome?

Was he legally able to buy a gun?  If so, why?  If not, how did he get one?

Of note, I also found multiple traffic offenses including being a repeat offender for driving without a license.  But the main issue is the weapons violation.

In short, this is NOT a ""law abiding gun owner.""  But we knew that.

And, of course, the shootings took place in a ""Gun Free Zone"" as it's now come out that the shootings were inside the buildings and we have at least one photo of him entering a building while drawing the handgun.  One can't legally carry inside an MSU building even if holding a valid permit.

**UPDATE** [Found his prison record](https://mdocweb.state.mi.us/otis2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=606937)

Apparently it the charge was lowered to a misdemeanor - ~~meaning he was NOT a prohibited possessor for THIS charge.~~

**EDIT**  ~~He was a prohibited possessor. The misdemeanor charge has a potential penalty of ""not more than 2 years"" which means that he's a prohibited possessor under 18 USC 922(d)(1)~~

**EDIT Again**

I forgot about 18 USC 921(20)(b) which says

&gt; crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year does not include

&gt; any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.

So, he MAY not have been a prohibited possessor.  The statute lists the crime he was convicted of as a ""misdemeanor.""  However, I'm finding anomalies in MI law such that a ""misdemeanor"" with a penalty of up to 2 years is also a ""Class G Felony.""  If the evaluation is on the statute saying ""misdemeanor"" on it then 921(20)(b) means he is **NOT** a prohibited possessor.  But if it's considered a ""felony"" then 921(20)(b) doesn't come into play and the crime is punishable by a sentence exceeding one year so he is a prohibited possessor.

At this point I'm thoroughly confused; but leaning towards him not being a prohibited possessor on the concealed without a permit charge that he plead guilty to.","gunpolitics",73,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1126k3x/msu_shooter_prior_arrest_felony_concealed_carry/"

I feel helpless knowing that I'm sending my child off everyday and worry for when he starts school. Will I have to buy him a Kevlar backpack? Will he not come home one day? I saw an article today that today is the 5 years anniversary of Parkland. 

I feel ashamed to be an American. We are not ""the land of the free"". I do not feel safe.

Compared to some of the other schools, Michigan State was a bit late in the game in terms of full integration of their football team. However, it started post WWII with legendary coach Biggie Munn who started recruiting black players in the South to play for Michigan State and it helped them win National Championships in 1951 and 1952. Duffy Daugherty was the successor and continued this practice of recruiting black players and eventually fully integrated the team in the 1960s, and eventually claimed national championships in 1965 and 1966, being the first fully integrated team to win natties in the process. 

As a black Spartan, I'm proud at what my alma mater was able to do in terms of helping progress civil rights in such an era and wanted to share it with y'all.

###Preface

The 2022 edition of the Detroit Lions was an archetype of a feel-good movie. No, they didn't win the championship. No, they didn't even make the playoffs. But the story of the season, as it played out, was one of near-ultimate disaster followed by one of the best redemption arcs you'll ever witness.

### 2022 Offseason

As it happens, I wrote last year's [Offseason in Review](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/wd7ofo/2022_offseason_review_detroit_lions/) for /r/NFL. Feel free to follow that link if you want to read the full writeup, but here are some of the high points:

* Ben Johnson promoted to OC, confirming the role he played after Anthony Lynn was fired midway through the 2021 campaign
* Veteran Free Agent WR DJ Chark signed, giving QB Jared Goff a weapon he absolutely needed considering the lack of options during the 2021 season
* Draft (more on these players later on):

* Detroit Lions featured in the preseason edition of HBO's *Hard Knocks*, granting an early look at the culture and team chemistry HC Dan Campbell (aka MCDC throughout the rest of this) is building in Allen Park.
* Preseason - most pundits figured the Lions good for between 5-6 wins; anything more than that would put the rebuild *well* ahead of schedule. In my Offseason Review, I was more optimistic, putting the O/U for the season at 7.5 wins, and predicting that they would finish 8-9 on the season.

### Week-by-Week Season Review

[Week 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alUxGeJTAl4): **PHI 38**|35 DET

* The first game of the year was a microcosm of the entire first half of the season. Absolutely electric offense, especially in the second half, but a defense that just couldn't stop or even slow down the opposing team for much of the game. This was also the first indication to the entire league this season that Jalen Hurts *might* be good. Of course, since he did it against the Lions, many people discounted his performance.

[Week 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJZWECsE2d0): WAS 27|**36 DET**

* The Lions get their first win of the season, and this time they didn't have to reach double-digit losses to do so! Detroit coasted to an easy 22-0 halftime lead, but even when the Commanders cut the gap to 8 pts early in the 4th qtr, this game never felt like the Lions let it get out of their control. Rookie DE Aidan Hutchinson scored three sacks in the win.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_tmuvagbC8)

[Week 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PAFAYNi3mA): DET 24|**28 MIN**

* This was one of a handful of games the team *really* wanted back, especially late in the season as the playoff race ramped up. The teams started by trading missed FGs before the Lions scored TDs on consecutive drives to go up 14-0. By halftime, however, Minnesota had caught up. The Lions' defense actually did okay in the 3rd qtr, bookending a 3-and-out and a fumble recovery around another missed FG for the Vikings. Meanwhile, Goff and the Lions regained a 10 point lead with two solid drives...then fell flat for much of the rest of the half. Some questionable clock and play decisions by MCDC allowed Minnesota to escape with the win - and force the Lions to the only division loss they would suffer the entire season.

[Week 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TEk17Jbaiw): **SEA 48**|45 DET

* If the Lions wanted the Vikings matchup back by the end of the season, they had to be *furious* at themselves for losing this one, considering the head-to-head loss in Week 4 would ultimately be the tiebreaker that would keep the team from the postseason. The Lions' defense absolutely collapsed, never once forcing Seattle to punt. In addition, two key turnovers directly led to 14 points for the Seahawks - a lost fumble in the 2nd qtr and a pick-six to open the second half. Detroit fought to close it up afterwards, helped by a SEA missed FG, but the gap was just too much to overcome. By the end of this game, the Lions were in the top 3 for the offense and absolutely dead last on defense.

[Week 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STecW2M_Yk0): DET 0|**29 NE**

* A completely forgettable game. Injuries to the offense bogged down an offense that had previously been playing lights out. In the second half, the Lions, facing a deep hole, went 0-4 on 4th down. Bailey Zappe did everything the Pats asked him to, meanwhile, going 17/21 for 188 yds, 1 TD, and 1 INT.

Week 6: ---BYE---

[Week 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qttnwr6YQt0): DET 6|**24 DAL**

* Coupled with Week 5's loss, this stretch of two weeks around a bye felt like a nightmare as a fan. 6 pts total to two emminently beatable teams, and in this game Dak Prescott in his first game of the regular season took advantage of the Lions' *five* combined turnovers, including a rare fumble by Jamaal Williams at the Cowboys' 1 yard line. 

[Week 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMdGq5ovdNw): **MIA 31**|27 DET

* The defense, once again, asked the offense to not make a single mistake. This game was actually in Detroit's control early one; up 21-7 at one point, and still up by 10 at the break, Tua just had his way most of the game. Even with that, though, the Lions still had a chance - it all came down to one call. 4th and 1 from the MIA 35 the offense *obviously*...threw it deep and missed. Hey, make it and you're the hero. Don't, and well... The team was now 1-6 and there were beginning to be rumblings about how long it would take to fire MCDC, and how the organization had botched yet another rebuild.

[Week 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yk8Xdso0XE): GB 9|**15 DET**

* DB coach Aubrey Pleasant was let go during the week before this game, and in Allen Park, the team held a players-only ""get right"" meeting. It worked. Coupled with the return of several players from injury, the rest of the season saw a resurgence of hope, optimism, and most importantly, wins. First up: Aaron Rodgers and his Packers that were in a downward spiral of their own. In a game of bad (at the time) teams, Detroit was slightly less bad - critical were three interceptions - two by Kerby Joseph and one by Aidan Hutchinson, all deep in Lions' territory. Kudos to the defense for balling out and holding the Pack to single digits after getting *crushed* the entire year to that point.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hd5I2okiSc)

[Week 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XX6l1P1h0I): **DET 31**|30 CHI

* Win #3 of the season came in dramatic fashion. A trip to Soldier Field looked like it was going to be a bitter one by the end of the 3rd qtr. Down 24-10, the Lions kicked it into overdrive. First, Swift scored one play after a CHI interception was wiped out by penalty. Two plays later, Jeff Okudah snagged a pass intended for Cole Kmet and jogged in 20 yards for the pick-six, and suddenly the game was tied. Justin Fields tried to win on his own, racing to a 67 yard TD that put the Bears back on top, but critically, they missed the PAT. Goff and the Lions responded by marching down the field and punctuating their second comeback of the game with - what else? - a 1 yd plunge by Jamaal Williams. PAT good, and the defense would finally make a crucial stand to finish the game out.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzo1u5SFzdM)

[Week 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZquLHM2ujI): **DET 31**|18 NYG

* The Giants came into this game 7-2 after playing well above expectations. The Lions came in 3-6 with wins over the so-so Commanders and two bad division rivals. None of that mattered, as Detroit held Saquon Barkley in check and cruised to an almost embarrasingly easy victory. 
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD6Y4LCmiUc)

[Week 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROU2VNy6Vk): **BUF 28**|25 DET

* This game will forever be remembered as the upset that could have happened, except that Goff underthrew an open DJ Chark, forcing the Lions to kick a FG and leave Josh Allen enough time to work his magic. LB James Houston did score a pair of sacks in his debut, showing the first flash of what would be an amazing story for him.

[Week 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2SJqlZR-SE): JAX 14|**40 DET**

* With a mini-bye under their belt, the Lions played very poor hosts indeed to Jacksonville. Finally, the *Lions* had a no-punt game (more specifically, they scored on all eight of their meaningful drives - no turnovers at all, and their ninth ""drive"" was a pair of kneeldowns), and this time, the defense actually kicked in a solid effort as well. This would be the Jags' final regular season loss, as JAX would go on to win the AFC South and squeak into the playoffs.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM3ZMCS7wA0)

[Week 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLS2MuJ4rRs): MIN 23|**34 DET**

* Detroit scores yet another win that almost seemed too easy for observers. It took the team about a quarter to find their footing, but once they did, they just put the pedal to the metal and peeled away from the Vikes, getting revenge for the early-season loss in Minnesota. Notably, WR Jameson Williams caught a 41 yard bomb for his first reception - and first TD. Goff followed that up with a 48 yarder to DJ Chark, making up for the miscue against the Bills two weeks prior.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrZXn_YAE1c)

[Week 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHKQc3vTe5M): **DET 20**|17 NYJ

* After scoring just three wins (okay, and a tie) all season during the 2021 campaign, here the Lions put together their 2nd three-win streak in just seven games. Their second trip to the Meadowlands in five weeks was much tougher than the first, but a gutsy call on 4th and 1 allowed Goff and TE Brock Wright to be the heroes this time (see: Week 8) - Wright's rumbling touchdown after the catch was an instant sensation.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uwrJOl0Ho8)

[Week 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aILh26hthhk): DET 23|**37 CAR**

* By this point, there was plenty of talk that the Lions might *actually* sneak into the postseason. At 7-7 following their second-half surge, they still needed every possible victory - especially after WAS and NYG had their tie, negating DET's tiebreaker advantage over each. Unfortunately, this trip to Carolina occured in the middle of an extremely harsh cold snap that put an already bad field into nearly impossible shape. Several complaints, including one by the NFLPA, were made following the game, but by then Carolina had done what it needed to in order to remain in position in the NFC South.

[Week 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFMjujQwOKU): CHI 10|**41 DET**

* No heroics needed this time. Losses by every other team in the hunt (except for Green Bay) kept the Lions in the playoff mix, and they took care of business by easily destroying the Bears at home, scoring 31 unanswered points to end the game.
* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5qUjapfBY)

[Week 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gglsiPZeCnQ): **DET 20**|16 GB

* Just three teams remained, with two of them going head-to-head. Green Bay, on a resurgence of their own following their mid-season loss to Detroit, joined the Lions and the Seahawks as the only teams left fighting for one single playoff spot. The NFL decided to toss Green Bay a bone and flexed this matchup to prime time - if Seattle won the afternoon game, then Detroit would be eliminated before the final game of the season even kicked off. Of course, that's exactly what happened, as the usual referee shenanigans Lions fans know so well screwed the team over in a game they weren't even directly playing in. None of that mattered, though. Kerby Joseph picked off Aaron Rodgers for the third time this season, and on what may be Rodgers' last ever pass as a Packer. It was a glorious rewrite of a story that was tailor made for Green Bay to march into the playoffs - instead, the Lions got their first winning season in years and ended the season on a jubilant note, winning 8 of their final 10 games.

### High Points

* Ben Johnson's offense proving to be for real

* Aidan Hutchinson proving the pre-draft hype
* Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jamaal Williams playing lights-out all season
* James Houston providing a needed defensive spark the second half of the season
* 8-2 in the final ten games

### Low Points

* Defensive woes, especially early on, leading to...
* A 1-6 start to the season
* Clock and playcalling miscues costing the team wins early
* Injuries - none worse than S Tracey Walker going out for the season
* Seattle knocking off the Rams and pushing the Lions out of the playoffs

### Roster Review

(**Starter**)/(Notable backup)

|POSITION|PLAYER|
|:--:|:--|
|QB|**Jared Goff**|
||Nate Sudfeld|

* Jared Goff did everything asked of him and more. While he had some turnover issues early (including a few pick-sixes and a fumble leading to a scoop &amp; score), he finished the final 9 games of the season with 0 INTs - and his current streak of 324 passes without an INT is already the 5th-longest in NFL history. His knock is that he's a system-QB, and not one to put a team on his back, but the difference is that he is *executing* that system at a level that no one would have believed two seasons ago when he was traded along with a raft of picks for Matthew Stafford. He has earned his spot on the team as QB1, and his rapport with Ben Johnson is off the charts.
* What *is* needed is something the Lions haven't had for a long, long time - a quality backup that can be trusted to win games if Goff goes down. It is possible that the Lions take a QB at #18 just for insurance - and unlike last year, it wouldn't send the message of ""here's your replacement as soon as you lose your first game"".
* Regardless of draft or free agent signing (Nate Sudfeld is likely not returning), what the Lions need in a backup is a more mobile QB - if for no other reason than to give the defense something vaguely resembling a running/ dual-threat QB to practice against.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|LT|**Taylor Decker**|
|LG|**Jonah Jackson**|
|C|**Frank Ragnow**|
|RG|**Halapoulivaati Vaitai**|
|C/G|**Evan Brown**|
|RT|**Penei Sewell**|
|T|Dan Skipper|
|G|Logan Stenberg|

* The Lions' line, collectively, performed at a stellar level - and that includes Frank Ragnow who suffered through a foot injury for much of the season.
* Dan Skipper earned a special shout-out by MCDC in the locker room after the team's Week 2 win over Washington, and bounced around the line filling whatever gap was needed. 
* At the time of this writing, the entire starting line (except for Brown) is still under contract for 2023, but I would not be surprised to see Holmes begin to draft quality prospects to ensure continuity of the high level of play the line has shown recently.
* Hal Vaitai is considered a starting player, but was out for the entire season after hurting his back in preseason. Evan Brown did marvelously taking over the spot. I don't think Vaitai is still with the Lions this coming season - likely cap casualty.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|RB|**D'Andre Swift**|
|RB|**Jamaal Williams**|

* Both D'Andre Swift and Williams can be considered starters here; Swift was used more in longer-yardage situations, while Williams was *near*-automatic in short-yardage, must-have plays - including the inordinate number of times Detroit receivers ended up getting tackled *just* short of the goal line. Williams' 17 touchdowns broke Barry Sanders' single-season record, led the league in total rushing TDs, and came in second for total TDs for the season.
* Swift's season was more up-and-down through the year. An early injury seemed to affect his play-making ability through much of the second half, but he still showed grit and ability throughout, and his 8 TDs certainly came in handy.
* Looking ahead to the draft, Bijan routinely gets mocked to the Lions - if that *does* happen, he most likely replaces Swift. More realistically, a 3rd or 4th round pick could give the team the replacement it needs while allowing for a more impactful player elsewhere earlier on. No matter what happens though, I believe the Lions do as much as they can to sign Williams to another contract - he's expressed a desire to return, and retaining his leadership would be a genuine plus. If you think he just wants to cash in - take a look at his [postgame interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubeJwtsHlUE) after the season finale, and then tell me that again.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|WR|**DJ Chark**|
|WR|**Amon-Ra St. Brown**|
|WR|Jameson Williams|
|WR|Josh Reynolds|

* It took some time for DJ Chark to live up to the billing and promise he showed when he was signed to a 1yr deal last offseason. Still, as the season went on, he showed an ability to click with Goff and serve as a long-range weapon. Chark has also shown a willingness to return, but with Jameson Williams getting a full offseason/ preseason to work with Goff, I think Chark will find a better deal elsewhere.
* Amon-Ra St. Brown, meanwhile, was electric in his return to the lineup. Just 6 TDs, but caught 106 passes for over 1100 yards on the season, and as he matures, should continue to provide a needed short-to-mid field outlet.
* Jameson Williams had been projected to return by the team's early bye week, but his rehab was taken *extremely* seriously by the team. As a result, his impact on the field was minimal, bvut his competitiveness was shown on the sideline the entire season.
* I don't know that the Lions, with so many other needs, will take a WR in the draft - but how free agency proceeds will go a long way towards determining the fate of this position for the team.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|TE|**Brock Wright**|
|TE|Shane Zylstra|
|TE|James Mitchell|

* After trading fan-favorite TJ Hockenson to rival Minnesota mid-season, his former teammates all took a step forward in production. Wright and Zylstra combined for 8 TDs between them (Zylstra with a 3-TD game against Carolina), and Mitchell showed some flash while still recovering from his prior ACL injury.
* It's possible the Lions go out and get a free agent here or spend a Day 3 pick on a prospect, just for depth and position-battle in training camp, but the position is *not* (despite how outside entities view it) a position of need at all for the team.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|DE|**Romeo Okwara**|
|DT|**Alim McNeill**|
|DT|**Isaiah Buggs**|
|DE|**Aidan Hutchinson**|
|DE|John Cominsky|
|DE|Levi Onwuzurike|
|DT|~~Michael Brockers~~|

* Aidan Hutchinson did a phenomenal job as a rookie EDGE rusher. Had Sauce Gardner not proved to be that rare cornerback who can come in and just shut *down* an entire side of the field as a rookie, Hutch might very well have walked off with RotY honors. He did win the fan voting for RotY, so it's not like his efforts went unrecognized.
* McNeill and Buggs both came up big in various moments this season, especially as the defense began to gel during the second half of the season.
* Romeo Okwara continued to be plagued by injury, and in his absence, John Cominsky provided a needed spark to help get both Hutchinson and, eventually, Houston free to menace the offensive backfield.
* This was not a defense that excelled against the run - so I fully expect the addition of a good, run-stopping DT to be acquired either through FA or, more likely, a Day 1/ Day 2 pick in the draft.
* Michael Brockers was released by the team in late February, adding more need to replenish the interior defensive line this offseason.

|:--:|:--|
|LB|**Alex Anzalone**|
|LB|**Malcolm Rodriguez**|
|LB|James Houston|

* Anzalone improved *dramatically* after Aubrey Pleasant's departure. For the entire 2021 and first half of 2022, Anzalone looked lost, frequently playing out of position and on at least one instance this season, running directly away from where the play was developing. His presence in the locker room, however, keeps getting called out as nothing short of exceptional, and for a position the team doesn't value highly, it was worth keeping him around. His improvement in play towards the end of the season bodes well for his future in the league.
* Rookie Malcolm Rodriguez was an instant hit during *Hard Knocks*, and his early season performance was a bright spark in a defense that desperately needed one.
* The real surprise, though, was the shocking impact of James ""Da' Problem"" Houston. On Thanksgiving against Buffalo, Houston racked up a pair of sacks and a fumble recovery. That impact would carry through the rest of the season, as he would end up with 8 sacks in 6 games. While not useful against the run, his pass-rush will be an exciting aspect of the team's defensive play moving forward.
* The team has plenty of assets in LB behind these three, but I'd expect Detroit to see who is available during free agency. Perhaps, like last season, they find another late-round addition, but this position should not be considered a major need from the team's internal perspective this offseason (regardless of what the media may claim) - *unless* the team decides to move on from Anzalone.

|FS|**DeShon Elliott**|
|SS|**Kerby Joseph**|
|SS|**Tracey Walker**|
|CB|Will Harris|
|S|Ifeatu Melifonwu|

* The defensive backfield is, in my own opinion, the position group with the highest need for improvement. Jeff Okudah was decent, though not great, and Jerry Jacobs continues to excel when compared to his original status as an UDFA. DeShon Elliott and Kerby Joseph likewise performed okay overall, even after Walker's season-ending injury.
* Everyone here is serviceable, but like the WR group last year, both S and CB need new additions to come in and move the entire rest of the depth chart down one. I will forever curse Quinntricia for jettisoning Darius Slay - the Lions haven't had a top-flight cornerback since.

|:--:|:--|
|K|**Michael Badgely**|
|P|**Jack Fox**|
|KR|**Justin Jackson**|
|PR|**Kalif Raymond**|

* Badgely came onto the team after ~~Riley Patterson~~ Austin Siebert failed early on and was released. (edit: credit to /u/eugene_rat_slap for the correction below! It was Patterson who was released in training camp.) It helped settle out the position, and Badgely finished the season 24/28 for FGs and 33/33 on PATs. However, his inability to boot from long-range led to the Lions needing to go for it on 4th down or try for short punts more than other teams. UofM K Jake Moody keeps getting mocked to the Lions late, and I wouldn't be upset to see that happen as a 6th or 7th round pick (regardless of my own status as an MSU fan).
* Jack Fox continues to excel, and should return for another season.
* Kalif Raymond earned a game ball for his punt return for TD against the Jets, and had quite a few great returns to help flip the field throughout the season.
* Justin Jackson quietly had a good KO return season, consistently getting decent field positions. Among all kick returners who fielded more than 8 returns, he ranked 9th in average return yards and 3rd in number of 20+yd returns. Not flashy, overall, but consistent.

### Coaching Staff Review

|TITLE|NAME|
|:--:|:--|
|HC|Dan Campbell|
|OC|Ben Johnson|
|DC|Aaron Glenn|

* This trio will return intact for the 2023 season, and has well earned that return. Both coordinators fielded head coaching interviews, with Johnson deciding to turn down the Panthers and the rest of the league early on, while Glenn returned for second interviews to the Cardinals and the Colts. Glenn did receive heat for the defense's failures early on, and it'll be interesting to see what he learns from that. That said, the defense's rebound after mid-season *is* a credit to his leadership.
* Dan Campbell and GM Brad Holmes are building a coaching roster full of prior players, bringing that on-field experience to the Xs and Os side of the field.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|Asst HC/ RB|Scottie Montgomery|
|QB|Mark Brunell|
|Asst QB|JT Barrett|
|Passing Game Coord|Tanner Engstrand|
|OL|Hank Fraley|
|WR|Antwaan Randle El|

* Duce Staley, the 2022 Asst HC/ RB Coach, departed for a similar position to the Panthers. In return, the team adds Scottie Montgomery to fill that void - coming most recently from the Colts. Tanner Engstrand moves up from TE coach and could be considered an OC prospect for as soon as the 2024 season, especially if Johnson decides to take head-coaching interviews more seriously than he did this offseason.

|||
|:--:|:--|
|DL|~~Todd Walsh~~|
|LB|Kelvin Sheppard|
|Asst LB|Shaun Dion Hamilton|
|DB|Brian Duker|
|CB|Dre Bly|

* Duker is confirmed as Pleasant's replacement here, but will be working hand-in-hand with new addition Dre Bly. Hamilton, meanwhile, was a former player who was cut during training camp last year, and comes back for a second season wearing a headset.
* One interesting addition, especially given the team's recent stretch of seasons with horrible injury news, is the addition of a staff member fully devoted to player health: [Brett Fischer](https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2023/2/12/23596699/report-lions-hire-brett-fischer-as-director-of-player-health-and-performance), the team's new Director of Player Health and Performance. Coupled with Detroit's swap of artificial turf this offseason, I'm intrigued by what a season with relatively few season-ending ACLs might look like!
* Todd Walsh (DL coach) ended up departing the team in mid-Feb to join the Panthers in the same role. As of right now, Detroit's own coach roster page only has Cameron Davis as an Asst. DL Coach - no replacement for Walsh has been named as of yet.
* Not listed above, former head coach journeyman John Fox was hired at the end of February as a Senior Defensive Consultant.

### Free Agents Breakdown

I strongly encourage people to take a few minutes and read /u/boanerges_77 's writeup on free agency as part of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/10ej51r/lions_mock_offseason_i_the_way_too_early_version/). I'll simply drop the list of free agents here; please go read that post, as they do a better job of explaining everything *much* better than I ever could. 

(*Editor's note*: Bo77 ended up deleting their account while in the middle of an entire series of posts about the state of the Lions' position groups - sad times, but this person was a *fantastic* writer for the sub. In addition, they were the writer of this post for last offseason, and graciously allowed me this opportunity this season, so...if you're reading this, thanks Bo, and good luck in whatever you're doing out there!)

### Team Needs for FA &amp; Draft

Note: These are just my own projections, mixing my own assessment with how I've seen the team prioritize positions - your mileage may vary, and the team's own internal decisions on this are likely to be different than everyone else's, including my own. These are also listed in no particular order.

|NEEDS|WANTS|
|:--:|:--:|
|CB|DE|
|S|RB|
|DT|WR|
|OL|LB|
|Backup QB|K|

* As mentioned above, the secondary needs some serious upgrades. Along with that, a good run-stopping interior lineman (or *maybe* a run-focused linebacker) would help get the defense off the field in more short-yardage situations.
* On the offensive side, the team should look at beginning to draft new talent in the trenches, and also figure out where they're getting a quality backup QB from. After that, they start to take a look at the skill positions.

### Why Root for the Lions?

* **Culture**. This organization is building a core of quality players, both on and off the field. Jared Goff was the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee, and well-deserved it was, but he wasn't the only one that could have been nominated. The team as a whole has been very involved with the community, both in the Detroit area as well as players' hometowns. The off-field shenanigans and distractions from other teams just don't exist in the same way for Detroit.
* **Identity**. From his very first press conference after being named Head Coach, Dan Campbell has made no bones about wanting to be a tough, gritty, hard-hitting team. No one can argue he hasn't done that. The ""next man up"" philosophy has been an absolute necessity as injuries both great and small have taken their toll.
* **Future outlook**. With their first winning record since the 2017 season, the team heads into the offseason with hope for the future. Even in the Caldwell era, with three playoff trips in four years, there was always this sense of ""when would the wheels fall off?"" Last season, people knew that the team needed not just a rebuild, but an absolute demolishing and reforming. This season just past, the team beat expectations for total wins, even after putting themselves in a major hole to start the season. Next year - at the very least the team will be expected to compete for their first-*ever* NFC North championship, and potentially much more.
* **Demise of SOL**. ""Same Ol' Lions"" has been a millstone of a moniker around the team's - and its fanbase's - collective neck for decades. 1 playoff win in the entire Super Bowl era, HoF careers for both Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson wasted (along with Matthew Stafford's time with the team), the curse of Bobby Layne - this team is opening the window to bring hope and glory to *generations* of fans. Join us - the long-suffering, the paper-bag wearers, the fanbase of ""just once before I die"" - as we cheer our team on to victory.
