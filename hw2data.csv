"2023-02-20",1676879835,"Really Emotional Week","The campus shooting at MSU on Monday night took place a mile from my house. I previously lived in Los Angeles for 20 years, so police activity is familiar to me, but the sirens and helicopters were relentless. MSU was my father's alma mater (he died in September on opening day of football season), and I grew up riding bikes to games with him. I never felt personally unsafe, but my heart ached for the students, and it felt like an assault on my childhood and my father's memory. Saturday my alma mater played his in basketball and I rooted for his team over mine, despite our teams being bitter in-state rivals. I signed up for a grief class at a local church. I took the same class after my grandfather's death and my cousin's suicide, but it's time to take it again. I cared for him in my childhood home before moving him into memory care, and now I'm going through it all over again with my mother. I just had to move my mother into memory care in December. I'm an only child and the only reason I'm in Michigan is because my (divorced) parents need me. I don't want to be back here. I miss my old life.","GriefSupport",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/11713cd/really_emotional_week/",2023-02-20 07:57:15

"2023-02-06",1675693079,"Chaos Space Marine Legionaries - Iron Warriors","**A simple question for the day - are Iron Warrior Legionaries a solid enough unit to build around?** 





I think they could now be on par with Noise Marines, but that may be a controversial take!





* Chaos Space Marine Legionaries are an all-purpose obsec unit which can be kitted out to be all melee, all shooting, or a hybrid of both. 


* They are also one of the few units that can take a Mark of Chaos and an Icon for the full benefit. 


* With the latest points update, you get free upgrades on the unit bar the balefire tome. 





Iron Warriors supplement the Legionaries further with:





1. The Iron Warriors legion trait provides a good durability boost against -1/-2 AP weapons. In addition the legion trait takes away cover save bonuses and hit modifiers from dense cover. 


2. Good stratagems such as Dour Duty (*-1 dmg*), Spiteful Endurance (*5+++ FNP vs Mortal*s) and Cold-Hearted Malignity (*auto-pass morale+boost to hit rolls for remainder of the game*). 


3. The Warlord Trait Implacable Taskmaster provides a 6'' aura of counting as having remained stationary. This means you can stock up on some Legionaries heavy weapons and still move up the field without penalty.





I think this all combines to make Iron Warriors Legionaries a viable build around. For example, a simple comparison is:





* 2 MSU Noise Marine Squads with Blastmaster, Icon and a Power Fist = 270 pts. 


* 3 MSU Legionnaire Squads with Reaper Chaincannon, Icon, Power Fist and a Heavy Chainaxe = 270pts. 





Now of course, you have to invest 1 CP into a Warlord Trait and the Legionaries are less effective vs heavier targets. However, it is not a bad comparison in my mind as Noise Marines are (were?) considered a great unit. You could of course also double down on the flexibility of Legionaries by taking the Mark of Tzeentch and bumping the squad up to 10 models for the extra heavy weapon or some Khorne Units. 





I love Iron Warriors and the idea of taking a load of Legionaries seems fluffy and possibly...good?","WarhammerCompetitive",54,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/10v7p8u/chaos_space_marine_legionaries_iron_warriors/",2023-02-06 14:17:59

How can I get back to working again?","Im finally starting to work regularly again for the first time since I became chronically ill (undiagnosed autoimmune disease). Im still sick, just slightly less so& and whatever I have makes my adhd 100x worse and more resistant to treatment.





Trying to compensate for being unproductive for so long, I overdid it last week. I worked two 9-5 days in a row, had late night meetings, and was able to work every day (even if I couldnt do a full day).





I felt *so proud of myself* for being able to work at all. After so long accomplishing nothing at all, I was even able to overcome that all-or-nothing mindset of needing to do things perfectly or not at all. I just slowly, steadily, and consistently worked all week and it felt AMAZING.





##Unfortunately, all week, I was working on the wrong project.





My weekly meeting with my boss was painful. Not only did I double book our *reoccurring meeting* (and had to reschedule after receiving a chiding email), but I also had zero updates to give her. 





She was understandably disappointed and frustrated. I mean, its been a year of barely working and the *one* week I finally have both energy and focus, I do the wrong thing. Thanks, ADHD.





My boss basically told me to shit or get off the pot in terms of my work- though she said it in much nicer and more professional terms.





She wasnt wrong about any of it. I seem to have reached the end of her usually generous understanding, and Im angry at myself for letting it come this far.





Trying to prove myself, I told her Id have some things done by our 9am meeting on Monday (tomorrow). But I was burnt out from working so much last week, causing my symptoms to flare. And since my boss has only ever been kind and understanding, my Rejection Sensitivity Disorder (RSD) has been a beast: From the moment our meeting ended, Ive been feeling an undercurrent of dread and anxiety when I think about working.





Getting this emotional hit after feeling proud of myself for the first time in so long was really destabilizing, and now the stakes of not working are even higher.





Every time I try to work, I become so anxious that my executive dysfunction completely paralyzes me- I sit just here, unmoving, yelling at myself to do things, and feeling more and more anxious as I continue to do nothing. Thinking of one thing that I need to do triggers my mind to think of *everything* I need to do, and it all becomes impossible. 





Its like a raging hurricane kicks up in my mind just because I looked at my laptop and considered checking my email >&<û
@





On top of all this, my symptoms are still flaring, Im about to start PMSing, and Im feeling hella funky from trying to switch to a new antidepressant.





Im so screwed, and Im just sitting here on Reddit, watching the minutes grow to hours, feeling tomorrows meeting getting closer like a growing nausea.





Does anyone have a way to escape from in this endless feedback loop of executive dysfunction loop and anxiety?





Has anyone else had this happen after getting yelled at by someone you wanted to be proud of you?





Update: I know this is a small post with little attention, but I needed to write this update. Trigger warning: &gt;!gun violence, death!&lt;





I work as a graduate student at MSU, and my two projects in this post were my Teaching work and my Research work. Last week, I focused all of my energy on teaching instead of research.





&gt;!Monday night, a student in my course was killed in the shooting at MSU. I dont directly teach her class section, but my section is filled with her friends- people who have grown with her for three years at MSU. My colleague who has taught her said she was an intelligent and amicable student.!&lt;





Everything is in such a different perspective now, you know? Im *really glad* I focused too much on my students last week. They had an exam on Friday, and those extra hours were put into helping them prepare for it. At least I was able to make the week before this horror a little easier.





That exam should have been one of the worst things about February for her. I remember telling my students that I hoped they all had a relaxing weekend after studying so hard for the exam. Did she get to rest before this happened? Did she get to celebrate getting through the exam?





All my worries feel so trivial now. And the landscape of teaching is going to be enmeshed with healing and finding ways to accommodate my traumatized and injured students. Maybe I wont focus as much on research as I should, but this *feels* more important, it feels right, RSD be damned.

Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.





 





Hello,





I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.   








The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.





Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.





If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.





We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.





I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.





Thank you,

Using Table Top Simulator I can do this without having to spend money.





That being said, I'm having a hard time figuring out what armies to actually look at that match the way I approach the game.  Maybe some of the people here can help?





As far as my playstyle, I definitely prefer to lean towards melee than shooting; it seems to me and has been my experience thus far, that the game largely gets decided in the middle turns with melee combat, not shooting.  So ideally I'd like a melee focus with shooting done to supplement that; for example, tanks/vehicles should operate like assault guns or modern-day IFVs and be able to act in support of the infantry (melee) units.





I also like a combined arms approach within the framework outlined above, so I don't want like to double down on ONLY melee and not have anything to complement it.  I do NOT like hordes, but I like MSU with a slight nod toward more elite-style armies, with specialized units.  Probably most of all, since I have trouble wrapping my head around a lot of the game nuances, I need something that has a low-skill floor with enough of a skill ceiling that as I learn and grow, the army opens up more opportunities.  That is, the basic tactics are relatively straightforward, even ""simplistic"", and can get results just with that, but the breadth of the units opens up as you get better.





***TL;DR***





**Likes**: Combined arms with a melee focus (i.e. shooting and vehicles designed to support melee), MSU, low skill floor w/high skill ceiling





**Dislikes**: Hordes, high-skill floor





Are there a faction and list ideas that can fit those criteria?  I figure that once I can narrow down a faction to look at, I can explore the unit choices in depth and see what's available (for example, I'd like to avoid Firstborn units for Space Marines as I'm pretty confident that they're going to be put into Legends in the near future, maybe as early as 10th edition)","WarhammerCompetitive",61,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerCompetitive/comments/116rmk7/which_armyarmies_fit_my_playstyle/",2023-02-19 23:37:05

Congratulations again! Like last year, **YOU created the safest Winter Carnival in 31 years!** You Huskied UP and listened to our advice. You looked out for each other. You protected the Husky Pack. 





**A ROUGH PAST COUPLE WEEKS**





The past couple of weeks have been rough on many of us for different reasons (e.g., exams, loss of loved ones, health, MSU mass shooting, and even a difficult decision I needed to make regarding a speaker invited to campus by a student organization). HuskyUP"" means kindness, listening, respect, caring, family, sense of belonging, civility, and community&and we have to embrace all these values even when we express different, unpopular, or controversial viewpoints.**SPRING BREAK IS HERE**We can all use a spring break which is coming up. Spring Break is a time when administrators tend to worry the most about students. **As you enjoy Spring Break, were gonna need you to HuskyUP"" and make safe, healthy, responsible, and mature choices.** Whether you are surfing on a beach, cruising on a ship, partying with friends, catching up with buddies, binge-watching movies, fellowshipping with people from your faith, or volunteering, stay safe.





**SPRING BREAK CHECKLIST**





* Keep valuables such as ID cards secure. *Please dont get stuck somewhere without your ID. We cant come get you.*


* Please, please let your parents, guardians, or loved ones know youre safe at least 3x. *No matter what you say, we* *still* *worry about you and always will!*


* Dont travel alone. Whos your travel buddy? Who got your 6? *People up to no good are less likely to mess with people in groups.*


* Dont lose your phone (in fact, just back it up right now on that cloud thing). 


* Dont rush. Allow yourself time to travel. *Rushing can lead to accidents.*


* Eat and sleep well. *Stop laughing - this is important to your health and wellness.* 


* Dont give in to peer pressure. *Real friends support,* *not* *pressure.* 


* Make sure someone else has your emergency contact information.  





**OKAY, LET THE MEMES BEGIN**





As your Dean of Huskies, it would be irresponsible to avoid some of the biggest concerns about spring break: the drinking, the partying, and those intimate encounters. *Yep, I was a college student too!* I also recognize that many of you will not be drinking, partying, or doing that *other* thing (*can you see my thankful hands?*).





* **Partying**. The Deans rules: Party in groups. Watch those hands. Dont put cups down in strange places. Remember stranger danger?


* **Intimate encounters**. Yup, I care, so Im going there. Nationally, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) may increase after spring break which is why I encourage #connectonadeeperlevel (talking and getting to know each other as people).

* **Confessions of spring breakers**. You can read stories [here](https://projectknow.com/discover/confessions-of-a-spring-breaker/) about what students wish they had not done.


* **Alcohol and other drugs: Know what you put in your body**


   * Know the laws and penalties of where youre going


   * Dont mix [alcohol ](https://www.mtu.edu/well-being/for-students/self-help-resources/substance-use-resources/alcohol-use/)and other substances


   * If you choose to drink, alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks


   * If you feel the effects of your drink are stronger than in the past, tell your buddy 


   * The effects of edibles ([cannabis](https://www.mtu.edu/well-being/for-students/self-help-resources/substance-use-resources/cannabis/)) may take longer than you think (90+ minutes)


   * THC levels in cannabis can be dangerously high - be aware of those levels if you choose to consume


   * Have a designated driver or sober companion

The college has failed time and time again to put the students and their mental health first. 1st year they make you feel warm and welcome and the second year they throw you to the dogs. For starters 2nd years do not even have class at the vet school but in the med school and they make sure we do not feel welcomed. Staff including the dean are leaving due to other faculty not listening to what students have to say or trying to help us. After the shooting a couple weeks ago they made it seem like our mental health would finally be taken care of but those promises have already been broken 2 weeks later. They are refusing to let us have zoom classes (despite using zoom to record lecture) even though students have voiced feeling uneasy and unsafe being in campus. The reply we get is ""research says we need to go back to normal."" They said they would be doing weekly check in on us yet they have not. I was just told not to go to the dean because she has more important things to worry about then her students. You only have 1 large animal rotations during clinics of which is primarily equine. If you want to do food animal you will be given little to no lectures on them. I completely regret my decision to go here and I am not the only one who feels this way. A stress survey was sent out (completely made by a student with no help for faculty) after many of us voiced concerns. The average stress level of 2nd years was 7.8 on a scale of 1-10. Nothing was done and faculty basically said there was nothing they could do. Mind you the wellness coordinator nor the dean knew about the survey til after the fact. Therapist have emailed the school saying something needs to be done for the students mental health and they wont even get a reply.

Hello,





My name is xxxxxxxxx. As a xx year old rural farm living American Democrat, I have absolutely no interest in any new gun legislation in Michigan. This recent shooting at MSU is an absolute tragedy but passing knee jerk legislation will actually be a disservice to the victims. The perpetrators father gave an interview and went on and on about how his son's mental health had slowly declined and he had become more and more erratic. I want you to be the bold representative who addresses the root of the problem with mass violence and suggests stronger mental health facilities and mental healthcare access in Michigan. As we look across the country we see many mass shootings and mass violence but the thing at the root of all of them is a metal health issue. Look at the shooting in Buffalo New York, the perpetrator of that crime apologized in court and wishes that they had had a mental health intervention or program that could have helped them before they killed those people. Putting roadblocks in the way of someone getting a gun is just delaying the inevitable if someone is determined to cause harm. Taking a proactive mental healthcare approach will stop individuals from wanting to cause harm in the first place. In Waukesha Wi a man used a car as a weapon to kill parade goers by running them over. Access to firearms wasn't an issue here but mental health interventions at some point in this man's life surely would have helped. This is the common thread that ties all of these horrible occurrences together. Access and availability of firearms has decreased with every law that is passed but it does nothing to stem the problem. The shooter in the Oxford highschool shooting was in the school councilors office with a piece of paper that showed how in distress this young man was. Nobody wants to say that the mental health system miserably failed this young child and could have prevented this terrible tragedy. Multiple gun laws were broken that day in Oxford but none of them including new ones that are being discussed now would have stopped someone intent on causing harm. What may stop it in the future would be mental health interventions at the appropriate time. I truly believe that new gun legislation will do nothing to stop mass casualty events, it will only serve to criminalize otherwise law abiding citizens. Please take a step back and really look at what solutions  will help with the problem of mass violence and try to implement those. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I look forward to a reply.

I just spent four hours in pitch black listening to sirens and helicopters and gun shots convinced I was going to die.

2*10 Warptalons

I&amp;S can deny enemy primary, pairs nicely with BEL and AL scout move strat imo.





Buff warptalons survivability with MoP and jam onto enemy DZ in turn 1, tagging shooting threat + moveblocking melee, score BEL.





Turn 2 do AL secondary with whats left (ah hopefully) with fall back and action warptalons and if theres little left then drop the obliterator in to fullfill secondary.





Turn 3 onward do skirmish with havoc, Legionaries and rhino forcing opponent to go wide. I can pull Legionaries into reserve and drop back in if i needed.





I will probably get tabled every game but i will dedicate every brain cell of mine to deny enemy secondaries and primary.

"2023-02-16",1676565381,"PSA: Alternative Gas Supplier solicitors/scammers","Yesterday afternoon, I was visited by a salesperson claiming to be ""auditing"" for Consumer's Energy and asking about my natural gas bill. I foolishly decided to let the guy see my most recent bill and signed some papers after he said he could lower my gas cost recovery rates from $6.26 per MCF to around $5.89 per MCF. The guy never said what company he worked for (made it sound like he was with Consumer's), never gave me his name, and he never said anything about what he was actually doing, which was signing me up to change my natural gas supplier from Consumer's Energy to Ardent Natural Gas LLC (the same logo as the one on his badge) without my full knowledge and/or consent. 





After feeling uneasy about what I did today at work, I started looking around online and realized what I had fallen for. Tons and tons of reports that Ardent has scammed people into signing contracts with them, promising lower prices, and then immediately jacking up their rates because their company only offers fixed rates for the first month and are not regulated by the MPSC so they can do whatever they want. There have also been tons of reports that they will try to charge you $100 to terminate your ""contract"" with them. 





I immediately called Consumer's Energy (800-477-5050) and requested that my account be locked and for them to deny any requested gas supplier changes for my address. It took them a couple of minutes to do so, but they got it done and promised that any attempts at changing my gas supplier would be denied. If they came to your place recently and you also fell for their scam, I highly recommend that you contact Consumer's Energy and do the same. 





The fact that they are trying to scam people like this is upsetting, but what makes things worse is that they are actively attempting to target survivors of a mass shooting (my apartment is right across the street from campus) less than two days after the event occurred. They knew what they were doing. They knew that we're more likely to fall for this scam when we were at our lowest. They are actively preying on the vulnerable, which is downright atrocious.





I will be filing complaints with the AG's office, writing scathing reviews on google and the BBB, and will likely file a police report just in case. If anyone else has any suggestions for things I can do to try and help stop them from doing this to more people, please let me know. I do not have any pictures of the contract, nor do I have pictures or recordings of the salesperson. 





If they show up to your door, either keep it closed or open it to tell them off and then close it. Don't be like me. Don't show them your energy bill. Don't let them in your house. Do your research before signing anything. 





This is not me saying that you shouldn't consider getting an alternative gas supplier. This is me saying that you should stay the hell away from Ardent Natural Gas LLC.

In 2015 I was homeless and staying on the MSU campus, often sleeping in the library and the union building or my car or the 24 hour McDonald's nearby when those were closed.





I still think of the library and the union building as my home away from home and I grew up in the city and still live nearby today. That was where the shooting happened and it feels like my safe place is gone.





I've been crying everyday since the shooting and I've had really bad headaches since as well. I have schizophrenia and my symptoms have gotten worse over that time,  I was looking at Facebook at my dad's profile picture where he's smiling and I started crying and then heard his voice in my head talking to me. I'm on meds so I don't hear voices too often nowadays but he called me right after and I told him I love him and that I was just hearing his voice in my head and it seemed like telepathy.





Everything is a bit overwhelming I just feel heavy in my head and I don't think I've been thinking right I've been thinking that I'm a saint and my purpose on earth is to help others. But I feel like every time I try and show compassion on reddit to people in a hard place they end up attempting suicide and I feel like I didn't say the right thing and it's my fault. I really try but it's so hard and makes my head hurt even more. 





I feel like I have to be sorry for venting about my own problems, but I know that's not something to be sorry for we all need support sometimes.





Love you all, I just don't know what to do I feel lost and powerless but I don't really even want to feel powerful I am scared of doing the wrong thing, but I wish I could find something to be happy about at least because I keep finding myself hurting and not feeling up to anything lately.","schizophrenia",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/114r0s5/ive_been_really_sad_since_a_tragic_event_a_couple/",2023-02-17 16:32:53

I dont expect the schools to be calling me, but is there something you guys sign up for that will alert you when certain schools decide to close?

"2023-02-21",1676950792,"I wish I lived in a country with reasonable gun laws.","But here I am. In rural America. Every time we have a string of mass shootings and our government does nothing, I become a little more convinced that our country is so deeply every man for himself that no meaningful regulation will ever be passed or enforced. I wish we had reasonable gun laws, but we dont. At what point is the rational decision to keep hoping and praying for gun control but also start carrying a gun of my own? 





For context, I have no military or law enforcement background. I have absolutely no desire to shoot another person. I would only ever consider pulling a weapon in a kill or be killed situation. I have never had a ccw or felt the need to carry a weapon in town. I am among many other things a hunter, I do carry a handgun in the woods in certain areas at certain times of year. I also keep my guns unloaded and locked up the rest of the year. I practice regularly, and Im not going to the Olympics, but I can breeze through any law enforcement shooting qualification test in the US(air marshal test is hard). After one too many mountain lion encounters I do carry a handgun during archery and muzzle loader hunting seasons. Any other time I count on making enough noise to scare off unwanted wildlife encounters. 





The MSU shooting hit really close to home for me(not geographically) and I cant shake the feeling that if I live in a country that refuses to protect me from the crazies and the wannabe cowboys. At what point is the rational decision to continue voting for gun control, but also acknowledge the reality that there are already people less qualified/sane than I with guns in the grocery store so why should I be the only one unarmed?

    ARTILLERY


    1 x Ironblaster (200)*


    


    TERRAIN


    1 x Great Mawpot (0)


    


    CORE BATTALIONS:


    *Battle Regiment


    **Command Entourage


    	- Magnificent


    


    TOTAL POINTS: (1960/2000)


    


    Created with Warhammer Age of Sigmar: The App





General game plan:





* deployment:


   * screen the ironblaster with the mawpot + frost sabres on a home objective


   * deploy kragnos and the stonehorn further forward, with the stonehorn sideways


   * put the three tyrants behind the stonehorn so they're screened from charges and protected from shooting by the new 'key to victory' rule


   * icebrow can either sit by the mawpot / help screen the ironblaster, or stay in reserve if useful for the battleplan


* rest of game:


   * icebrow puts keening gale on kragnos so it keeps up with the stonehorn


   * if not attempting turn 1 charges, 'leadership of the alpha' can be used to auto-run the tyrants so they keep up (exactly) with the stonehorn, otherwise save it for a triple all-out-attack


   * charge with the stonehorn and tyrants and enjoy big impact mortals on 4+ and 3+


   * use the new stonehorn monstrous action to fight something squishy if there's space in the back


   * charge with kragnos, especially fun if you roll high on impact ability vs monsters


   * take long cannonball shots with the ironblaster, and creep forwards (with frost sabres) to stay in range; if enemies get close and charge, unleash hell hail shot can hurt them a lot


   * icebrow is flexible, can move up and keep boosting movement, hang back and apply a 6+ ward to the ironblaster for counter shooting, or come in as a reinforcement to capture a side objective


   * don't forget to use the triumph (if you have it) to re-roll a key charge, especially if low on CP when the icebrow is in reserve





Changes and alternative options:





* I actually ran 'flask of stonehorn blood' and 'fuelled by ghurish rage' on the second and third tyrants, but found these pretty lacklustre for survivability, and usually ended up charging with them before activating either. The gryph feather tyrant *always* survived much longer, so I've swapped in amulet of destiny, and leadership of the alpha since it synergises really well with three tyrants. Another alternative would be tunnel master on the icebrow, so it can stay on the board for early prayers but also do some sneaky later game objective captures.


* You can add another tyrant if you swap the stonehorn for MSU mournfang, adopting a similar strategy of using them to screen the tyrants. I chose the stonehorn version because the monstrous action is great, and it's a nice distraction carnifex to keep the tyrants alive if nothing else. Also, if you don't care about (or prefer) high drops, with another tyrant you can get another 'magnificent'.


* You could also replace the stonehorn with gluttons for a slower march up the board, and a big triumph bid. Impact mortals would be on 4+ for either, but gluttons risk that dropping if they take casualties, and can't do the cool monstrous action, but will probably do more damage in melee once they arrive.


* One fun thing this list can't do is the new mortal wound spell, so it could be fun to take an arcane tome or swap a tyrant for a natural wizard.





If you decide to play the list (or a variant) I hope you have as much fun as I did - this post is already pretty long so I'll stop here, but if anyone is interested in a breakdown of my games I'd be happy to follow up.","Mawtribes",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Mawtribes/comments/10w3c3n/meme_list_for_new_ghb_meatfist_tyrants_kragnos/",2023-02-07 14:35:17

Well, MSU was shot at last week, as a result my school (that is also in Michigan) had a moment of silence that lasted about 4 seconds and it made me so angry. 





Half-assed moments of silence do not stop school shootings, nor does it help those affected. Regular mental health checks with students stop school shootings. Actually making an attempt to stop bullying instead of just saying you have a ""zero tolerance policy"" stops school shootings. Taking shooting drills seriously stop school shootings. The government is doing nothing to help us so it is time for the schools to step in.





I am seriously so frustrated because I know that if I voiced this opinion to the school they'd label me a delinquent and give me a few detentions for calling them out. We're clearly not getting gun laws or mental health care or livable wages anytime soon so it's time for the students and schools to step up. I could go on and on but it's truly disheartening that we have to risk our lives at school everyday and no one is doing anything to help.














Hope this doesn't get flagged as a rant, because I want to have a discussion. This is not an r/offmychest thing.","school",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/117p25n/moments_of_silence/",2023-02-21 00:11:28

"2023-02-15",1676474721,"What little we know about the MSU shooting","There's not much we know definitively about Anthony McRae, the guy who attacked Michigan State University. However, we know he was previously charged with multiple felonies related to carrying a firearm without a license, although those were pled down to misdemeanors. There is also reliable reporting that police frequently received reports of negligent/reckless discharge from his neighborhood, as he often fired his guns out of his back door for target practice. Regardless, he purchased the two handguns he likely used for this attack legally, because he had no felony convictions.





I'm torn. Someone who knowingly violates firearm laws and discharges firearms inside a neighborhood is clearly reckless and gives the gun owner community a bad name. Even if many of us might argue that constitutional carry should be the norm, I think we would all agree that knowingly violating concealed carry laws (unless you're deliberately trying to be a test case for a constitutional challenge) is irresponsible gun ownership. But when does irresponsibility, recklessness, and outright illegal conduct become so serious that we would want the person to be restricted?





In a number of states, the ability to obtain a concealed carry license can be a defense to unlicensed carry anyway, so is this really even the fault of the prosecutor for accepting a misdemeanor plea instead of going for the felony charge?





I don't necessarily think that the solution is tighter imposed restrictions, but it might make sense for prosecutors and courts and legislatures to start promoting voluntary restrictions. E.g., ""You've been charged with a felony crime that is either violent in nature or involves firearms. If convicted, you would be a felon and permanently lose your second amendment rights. However, this is your first offense and the prisons are overcrowded, so we will give you a misdemeanor plea deal on the condition that you agree to a court order that you don't purchase, possess, or use firearms for five years. Deal?""





That sort of particularized, individualized, voluntary approach seems better than broadly-sweeping restrictions. At least to me.","DCGuns",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/DCGuns/comments/1130jam/what_little_we_know_about_the_msu_shooting/",2023-02-15 15:25:21

Most significantly: Why was there another school shooting. Why did a 6 year old bring a gun to school and shoot his teacher. Why are people going through the second school shooting in their lives.





Why did I sit, trying to call my old teammate/ friend hoping hes ok. Hoping I wont see his name or a memorial post about him before getting to talk to him.





Luckily he was off campus when the incident occurred. But what about the dozens of other people whos loved one got hurt or killed. And the hundreds of students who have to walk around the campus they saw shots being fired on. 





My generation has had to do active shooter drills since elementary school. And the fact that it is still a problem, and people, especially the dozens of children, who were killed werent enough for a change is partially why we are feeling so fucking hopeless.





We have seen all these relatively avoidable problems happen over and over agian, and we have been stuck watching . But now it feels like nothing will be changed in time. The media will sweep it under the rug, and the next celebrity story will take priority.

Im not sure if I can entirely see this through because it makes me feel a strange sense of guilt for having a good or lucky day, which most of my days are. I know his point was that balance allows us to appreciate good and bad and that we cannot have one without the other.

On Monday night, February 13th,  a  43 year old suspect, Anthony Dwayne McRae caused the passing of three promising college students of Michigan State University.  There was a four hour manhunt for the suspect while students sheltered in place. 





It was a devastating and chaotic night. Quickly, campus police, various levels of law enforcement officers, emergency workers and others arrived to the scene. A tip from a caller led police to find the suspect. 





Anthony Dwayne McRae passed away from a self-inflicted weapon wound as law enforcement were closing in on him. He lived only a few miles away from the University campus. 





There are five wounded students who were taken to the hospital. So far, they havent been identified. 





Anthony McRaes uncle admitted that he suffered from Paranoid Schizophrenia.





Anthony McCrae was not taking medications nor receiving treatment for his illness. Possibly his motive was the effect of him feeling mistreated by businesses. He did not feel valued. Still there isnt a link between him and the university. His problems caused innocent people with a purpose to lose their lives &.way too soon. 





The **slain student**s are Arielle Anderson who was a junior, Alexandria Vernor, a junior and Brian Fraser who was a sophomore.  





Arielle Anderson graduated from Grosse Pointe North in 2021. She was a native of Harbor Woods and passed away on campus. She was an aspiring Pediatrician. She absolutely loved children and her hope was to become the first doctor in her family. 





Alexandria Vernor was a Biology and Anthropology student. She was from the Detroit area. On that tragic night, Alexandria Vernor was inside of a campus building. 





Brian Fraser was the chapter president of his fraternity-Phi Delta Theta. He studied Business was known for his leadership skills. In 2021, he graduated from Grosse Pointe South. During the crime, he was working on campus at the Student Union.

Ive been trying to figure out school with my toddler. Shes 3. Its paralyzing me. We are in Michigan. And now some of the kids who survived ortonville were right back in it at msu. So two school shootings theyve had to survive. Within 14 months.

I can find no record of the case in the other circuit and there's nothing to indicate that the bond was ever returned.





Is the case still pending four years later?





Was the case dismissed?  If so, why?





What was the outcome?





Was he legally able to buy a gun?  If so, why?  If not, how did he get one?





Of note, I also found multiple traffic offenses including being a repeat offender for driving without a license.  But the main issue is the weapons violation.





In short, this is NOT a ""law abiding gun owner.""  But we knew that.





And, of course, the shootings took place in a ""Gun Free Zone"" as it's now come out that the shootings were inside the buildings and we have at least one photo of him entering a building while drawing the handgun.  One can't legally carry inside an MSU building even if holding a valid permit.





**UPDATE** [Found his prison record](https://mdocweb.state.mi.us/otis2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=606937)





Apparently it the charge was lowered to a misdemeanor - ~~meaning he was NOT a prohibited possessor for THIS charge.~~





**EDIT**  ~~He was a prohibited possessor. The misdemeanor charge has a potential penalty of ""not more than 2 years"" which means that he's a prohibited possessor under 18 USC 922(d)(1)~~





**EDIT Again**





I forgot about 18 USC 921(20)(b) which says





&gt; crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year does not include





&gt; any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.





So, he MAY not have been a prohibited possessor.  The statute lists the crime he was convicted of as a ""misdemeanor.""  However, I'm finding anomalies in MI law such that a ""misdemeanor"" with a penalty of up to 2 years is also a ""Class G Felony.""  If the evaluation is on the statute saying ""misdemeanor"" on it then 921(20)(b) means he is **NOT** a prohibited possessor.  But if it's considered a ""felony"" then 921(20)(b) doesn't come into play and the crime is punishable by a sentence exceeding one year so he is a prohibited possessor.





At this point I'm thoroughly confused; but leaning towards him not being a prohibited possessor on the concealed without a permit charge that he plead guilty to.","gunpolitics",73,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1126k3x/msu_shooter_prior_arrest_felony_concealed_carry/",2023-02-14 14:23:07

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially  in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous  back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to  offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.





Some  people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week  between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.





I  watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw  in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on  each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in  this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped  themselves, at the end.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State





While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.





I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.





Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane





Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.





Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.





More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.





Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State





Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.





While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.





In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty





Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.





The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.





Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford





This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.





There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.





Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State





These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.





Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.





During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State





Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.





When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.





However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland





I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.





Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.





With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA





I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.





We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.





I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota





Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.





Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.





During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State





I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.





The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.





Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia





This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.





After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.





Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin





Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.





Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.





In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee





A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.





And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.





In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State





While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.





After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.





On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina





A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season





**Team: New England Patriots**  


Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  


Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18





Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.





Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.





This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.





Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story





Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 





The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 





This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.





Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 





Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs.

#Three Quick Questions





**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**





The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.





**What the hell happened with the coaches?**





All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  


&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him





This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.





The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 





So why Patricia? Well, he was available.





**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**





Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 





Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers





Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.





**Three cheers for...**  


*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*





These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.





You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.





**Three jeers for...**  


*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*





Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.





And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  





The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.





##Highlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 





**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.





##Lowlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.





**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 





Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*





##2022 NFL Draft Recap





**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**





**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.





**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**





**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**





**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.





**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**





**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete





**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete








The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward. 





**2022 draft grade-right now (B+)**


***


#2022 Free Agent Review  





##Notable Additions





**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.





**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.





**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.





**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.








##Departures





**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.





**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.





**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.





**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.





**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.





**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.





**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

#Season Statistics

|Pressures|110|*||








Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)





Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.





Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.





*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

**QUARTERBACKS**





| Quarterback Comparison | Mac Jones 2021 | Mac Jones 2022 | Bailey Zappe 2022 |


|:--|:--|:--|:--|


|Games Played|17|14|4|


|Total Yards|3801|2997|781|

|QBR|56.9|36.2|34.5|


|Passer Rating|92.5|84.8|100.9|








Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 





Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  








I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)








In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 








Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles. With Harris struggling to stay healthy, and having his carries cut nearly in half [(202 in 2021 to 106 in 2022)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3925347/damien-harris), Rhamondre took the helm as workhorse for the team. Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.








In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.








All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 





While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*  





##Roster Review  


Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.





##Quarterbacks





**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  





Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.





Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.


***


##Running Backs





**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.





**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.





**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.





**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.





**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.





**Damien Harris** UFA


***


##Wide Receivers





**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.





**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.





**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.





**Nelson Agholor** UFA





**Jakobi Meyers** UFA





**Matthew Slater** Re-signed





**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.





**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.





**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.





**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.





**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.





*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.


***


##Tight Ends





**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.





**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.





**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.





*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.


***


##Offensive Line





**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.





**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.





**James Ferentz** UFA





**Yodny Cajuste** RFA





**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.





**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.





**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.





**Marcus Cannon** UFA





*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).





**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.





Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 


***


##Defensive Line 





**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.





**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.





**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.





**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.





**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.


***


##Defensive Ends





**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.





**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.





**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.





*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)


***


##Linebackers and Defensive backs





Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.





Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

"2023-02-22",1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 





\-Going back to work.





The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 





\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.





From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 





\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.





In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 





However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.





The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 





This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.





\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest





With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 





Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 





I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 





I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

"2023-02-22",1677044568,"Mental Health Resources","Hey guys, I hope youre all doing as well as possible, given the circumstances.





I have been having a hard time and ended up using a lot of the mental health resources MSU has provided. I was very nervous about using them, not knowing what to expect with each, so I thought Id share my experiences with them here. I figure if writing this helps one other Spartan, its worth it. Everything Ive used and more can be found at [https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/)





Grouped by degree of interaction, since that was the hardest part for me, then ranked within each group by order of helpfulness to me personally (YMMV):





**1. No interaction**





* Short Webpage: [Managing Your Distress After a Tragic Event](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/distress_students/index.html)


   * **10/10 start here**. **If you do nothing else, give this a read.**


* [Spartan Resilience Training Program Reflect and Connect Sessions](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/feb2023crisisresponse/reflect_connect_feb13.html)


   * Cannot recommend signing up for one of these sessions enough. Extremely helpful.


   * You do not have to turn on your camera and there are no breakout rooms. You can participate in the Zoom chat as much or as little as you'd like.


   * For MSU faculty, staff and graduate students - focus is on normalizing the range of reactions right now, and how to help yourself so that you can be there for your students, supervisees, etc.


   * You need to sign up for a session to get the Zoom link.


* Online recording of MSU Webinar: [Developing Resilience in the Wake of Tragedy](https://vimeo.com/799997473/226de731e9)


   * I found it helpful for basic starting information on what is normal to be experiencing right now, answers to the immediate what do I do questions, and an idea of how to start moving forward. Theres also a Q &amp; A at the end with student questions, and it was reassuring to hear other Spartans ask about difficulties Im having as well.


   * CW: Some of the student questions at the end briefly mention where they were on campus and their experience.


* [Uwill Self-Guided Tutorial Videos](https://app.uwill.com/)


   * Free if you sign up with your MSU email


   * Short guided meditation, breathing exercise, and yoga videos.


   * Nothing specific to trauma, but potentially helpful for relaxation and sleep.


   * ADHD gang and anyone else struggling with slowness/stillness right now may find moving meditation more helpful, which isnt on here.





**2. Text-only interaction (anonymous &amp; available 24/7)**





* [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline)


   * You text with a trained counselor about how youre feeling and whatever difficulties or concerns youre having. Like a normal text conversation, it takes them a few minutes to reply sometimes, and it doesnt feel as personal as talking to someone on the phone or IRL.


   * They consider mass shootings a type of disaster and so the counselors refer to last week as a disaster which felt a little odd at first, but otherwise it was helpful to me, particularly for talking about survivors guilt, nightmares, and that sort of thing.


   * They noticeably use some pre-generated messages where they fit, but this isnt because the counselor youre chatting with is disingenuous, just that there are a limited number of volunteers, so they save time by having frequently repeated messages handy to copy and paste. If anything, it means a lot of other people have needed to know/hear the same thing, which is reassuring in its own way.


* [988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/)


   * While suicide is in the name, this service is for anyone in emotional distress.


   * You text with a trained crisis counselor about how youre feeling. They listen, reassure, and help you figure out what you can do to feel a little bit better in the moment. The goal of the conversation is to get you out of that feeling of acute distress, so felt most helpful to text when I was feeling awful, like after a vivid nightmare.


   * At the start of the chat, they ask you to rank how distressed you are and if youre having thoughts of ending your life. If youre not in imminent danger, you may wait a bit to be connected with a counselor.


   * This one was hit or miss for me. Ive used it twice now, and one person I spoke with was incredibly kind and helpful, like talking to a wise older sibling that really cares. The other felt much less authentic, and I didnt find particularly helpful.


* There are a lot of other text helplines, I just havent tried them. [You can find a list on this page if you scroll down and click ""Text, Phone and Hotline Resources""](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/index.html)





**3. Zoom interaction**





* [Finding a long term therapist on ThrivingCampus](https://msu.thrivingcampus.com)


   * **The most helpful thing for me has been finding a therapist to work with via ThrivingCampus.** I saw them on Zoom, but some therapists offer IRL appointments as well (says on their profiles).


   * Lets you filter by identity, practice area, insurance, types of issues they work with, and other factors. If you select available for crisis response in the filtering sidebar on the left, youll only get therapists who have specifically signed up to be available in the aftermath of incidents like this.


   * Pros: I was able to find someone to start seeing that week from the same fairly small identity group as me. The sessions are about an hour long (exact length depends on the therapist and your insurance), which allowed a lot more time to get into things vs just skim the surface.


   * Cons: It is normal therapy like if you found them on Google, so while the website to find them is free, the sessions cost money. How much will depend on your insurance. There is a section at the top left to filter by therapists offering limited free sessions, but I did not try that and don't know how it works.


* [Uwill 1-on-1 teletherapy](https://app.uwill.com/)


   * Free 30 min Zoom session with a licensed therapist - just need to sign up with your MSU email.


   * Pros: you get to pick the therapist. The one I spoke with was an MSU alum and very nice.


   * Cons: 30 min goes by quickly. It helps to make a list ahead of time if there are questions or topics you want to make sure to get to.


   * After your first session, you have the option to schedule more free Zoom sessions, or you can do them on the phone, via text, or by email. Personally, Ive found being able to send an email to the therapist I spoke with really helpful just to have someone Im not as worried about judging me to tell how a tough day went and get some support and suggestions. They reply within 24 hours.

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.





Some people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.





I watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in this process.

### Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State





While Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State. Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion for the next names up.





I thought throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes, and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three  although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball through a big hit.





Obviously Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown, including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day. However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly on multiple occasions.

### Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane





Unless youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked 1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over 1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the Year.





Spears was the biggest winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut schemes the second practice.





More importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden, where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched the ball during full team period.





Still, Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

### Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State





Now combining the running back position and the school I started with in Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021, Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team All-Mountain West accolades.





While his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he simply didnt lose many reps.





In team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions. That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards) early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

### Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty





Just a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish, losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the air as the next four players combined.





The first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one, because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a window for the ball to arrive.





Douglas made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was voted the WR of the Week for that side.

### Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford





This guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again big-time during Senior Bowl week.





There were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running. Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back to the QB.





Along with the way he was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline, after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action, where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

### Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State





These all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular. Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards in each of them.





Day one, this guy kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on. Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by DBs untouched basically.





During team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro, he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually during those drills.

### Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State





Now, on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11 passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.





When you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple of steps on the DB.





However, hed also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the 16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

### Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland





I had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all but three of his final 42 games.





Athleticism was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback. His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never lined up at Maryland.





With that being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order to create movement in the run game on top of that.

### Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA





I had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C. States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league coaches.





We had a lot of powerful interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones, and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was able to ride that guy past the QB.





I dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos, to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340 pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that, he was named the West IOL of the Week.

### Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota





Its not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the country this past season.





Everything this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once looping around towards the center.





During team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each, and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one of them.

### Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State





I really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall, Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier, but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for 33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes batted down at the line.





The question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at 342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.





Watching him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

### Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia





This has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to first-team all-conference the latter two years.





After lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give him ground.





Yet, Stills mightve been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him, to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through, trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting another one on the last defensive play for the East.

### Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin





Unlike the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned. Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10) and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.





Since I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.





In run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display, winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside. Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his effort chasing away from the play.

### Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee





A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer to an early day three prospect.





And what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage. During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck for the interception.





In team run drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his hands, to slither around them.

&amp;#x200B;





### Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State





While I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety, outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.





After showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside, you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two, once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.





On top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen  not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly. Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine invite.

### Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina





A position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two sacks across his two seasons there.

He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.





Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.





This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.





He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.





EDIT: My dad and I know the NRA is not directly responsible for mass shootings but their consistent deflect of any criticism pertaining to mass shootings and gun violence is why he decided to end his membership.","offmychest",112,"https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/112cj74/my_father_called_me_and_said_hes_ending_his_nra/",2023-02-14 18:33:19

"2023-02-26",1677380843,"The Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team scored almost as many points today as the football team's offense did the entire 2022 season.","Today, Iowa defeated Michigan State 112-106 in overtime. I didn't see it, but it must have been an insane game. We all know how sad and inept the Hawkeyes were on offense this past season, and it seems their basketball team is an exact opposite. 112 is a very high total for basketball, and I was wondering if they outscored the football team's offense.





So let see who scored more. Iowa offense (football) the entire season, or Iowa offense (basketball) in this single game.





Keep in mind that a large part of Iowa's success last year came from defense and special teams. I am considering field goals and extra points as special teams points. The target is Iowa basketball's total today, **112**





Game 1, South Dakota State: 0 points on offense. They won from a field goal and two safeties.





Game 2, Iowa State: 6 points on offense. One touchdown.





Game 3, Nevada: 18 points on offense. Three touchdowns.





Game 4, Rutgers: 6 points on offense. One touchdown, but the defense scored twice





Game 5, Michigan: 12 points on offense. Seriously, Michigan, how did they score against you?





Game 6, Illinois: 0 points on offense in a game that featured only field goals





Game 7, Ohio State: 0 points on offense, but they got a neat scoop and score





Game 8, Northwestern: 18 points on offense. Unfortunately NU was so bad last year they let Iowa explode like a volcano against them for three touchdowns.





Game 9, Purdue: 18 points on offense. At think at this point in the season Brian Ferentz figured some things out.





Game 10, Wisconsin: 12 points on offense. The two touchdowns were accompanied by an interception return for a TD

Game 12, Nebraska: 12 points on offense

Lawmakers across the country have filed hundreds of pieces of anti-transgender legislation for the 2023 session, setting out to further marginalize a community of people who already faced a year of unprecedented violence and threats to their existence.





While the media often portrays the anti-LGBTQ+ mission of Americas rightwing elements as part of a culture war, some members of the community, allies, and activists argue that it is best described as a (state) government-sponsored genocidefar from a nebulous battle of ideas and values. Depending on what state one lives in, various expressions of LGBTQ+ identity are actively being legislated out of existence and criminalized. Transgender individuals, in particular, are being stripped of rights at an alarming rate by lawmakers beholden to rightwing propaganda campaigns. Working in concerteither intentionally or unintentionallywith far-right extremists, this combination amounts to a coordinated attempt to eradicate the transgender community from wide swaths of the nation.





#Gender affirming care





*Definition: Gender-affirming care is a model of care which includes a spectrum of social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individuals gender identity.*





One of the strongest examples of how anti-transgender laws can be considered a form of genocide are bills that ban gender affirming care. Pay special attention to part (b) in the following definition:





The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [defines](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) genocide as any acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; **(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group**; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.





Legislators in 37 states have filed bills that prohibit gender affirming care in various forms and for various age groups. If successful, their states will join the [four](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/youth-access-to-gender-affirming-care-the-federal-and-state-policy-landscape/) that previously banned gender affirming care for minors.





These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 





* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.





* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.





* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.





Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.





Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 





&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.





* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.





* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.





#Child Abuse





Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.





In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 





&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.





Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 





* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 





* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.





* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.





* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide





Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 





Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.





The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.





##Classification





Definition: Division of us and them





Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi





Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.





These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 





Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.





##Dehumanization





Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group





Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin





During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 





The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 





Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.





After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 





&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.





&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.





Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 





###Drag performances





Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 





Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.





* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.





* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.





* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/",2023-02-17 17:35:02

These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 





* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.





* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.





* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.





Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.





Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 





&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.





* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.





* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.





#Child Abuse





Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.





In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 





&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.





Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 





* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 





* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.





* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.





* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide





Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 





Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.





The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.





##Classification





Definition: Division of us and them





Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi





Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.





These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 





Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.





##Dehumanization





Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group





Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin





During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 





The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 





Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.





After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 





&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.





&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.





Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 





###Drag performances





Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 





Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.





* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.





* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.





* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/",2023-02-17 17:35:02

"2023-02-14",1676399599,"My father called me and said hes ending his NRA membership because of the Michigan State shooting","My father has been a lifetime member of the national rifle association and always donated to the group. He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.





Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.





This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.





He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.

"2023-02-26",1677380843,"The Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team scored almost as many points today as the football team's offense did the entire 2022 season.","Today, Iowa defeated Michigan State 112-106 in overtime. I didn't see it, but it must have been an insane game. We all know how sad and inept the Hawkeyes were on offense this past season, and it seems their basketball team is an exact opposite. 112 is a very high total for basketball, and I was wondering if they outscored the football team's offense.





So let see who scored more. Iowa offense (football) the entire season, or Iowa offense (basketball) in this single game.





Keep in mind that a large part of Iowa's success last year came from defense and special teams. I am considering field goals and extra points as special teams points. The target is Iowa basketball's total today, **112**





Game 1, South Dakota State: 0 points on offense. They won from a field goal and two safeties.





Game 2, Iowa State: 6 points on offense. One touchdown.





Game 3, Nevada: 18 points on offense. Three touchdowns.





Game 4, Rutgers: 6 points on offense. One touchdown, but the defense scored twice





Game 5, Michigan: 12 points on offense. Seriously, Michigan, how did they score against you?





Game 6, Illinois: 0 points on offense in a game that featured only field goals





Game 7, Ohio State: 0 points on offense, but they got a neat scoop and score





Game 8, Northwestern: 18 points on offense. Unfortunately NU was so bad last year they let Iowa explode like a volcano against them for three touchdowns.





Game 9, Purdue: 18 points on offense. At think at this point in the season Brian Ferentz figured some things out.





Game 10, Wisconsin: 12 points on offense. The two touchdowns were accompanied by an interception return for a TD





Game 11, Minnesota: 6 points on offense





Game 12, Nebraska: 12 points on offense





Bowl Game, Kentucky: 6 points on offense, and their defense helped the offense with two scores of their own, without allowing Kentucky to score at all!





I was hoping this would be a funny Reddit post but unfortunately it seems that I have wasted my time, as Iowa's offense scored **114** points worth of touchdowns in 2022, and did manage to outscore the basketball team's performance today by 2 points. However, if you selectively change the statistical qualifier to say *regular season,* then Iowa's basketball team *did* outscore their football team's season-long offensive output today.","CFB",67,"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/11c3s71/the_iowa_hawkeyes_mens_basketball_team_scored/",2023-02-26 03:07:23

Hello,





My name is xxxxxxxxx. As a xx year old rural farm living American Democrat, I have absolutely no interest in any new gun legislation in Michigan. This recent shooting at MSU is an absolute tragedy but passing knee jerk legislation will actually be a disservice to the victims. The perpetrators father gave an interview and went on and on about how his son's mental health had slowly declined and he had become more and more erratic. I want you to be the bold representative who addresses the root of the problem with mass violence and suggests stronger mental health facilities and mental healthcare access in Michigan. As we look across the country we see many mass shootings and mass violence but the thing at the root of all of them is a metal health issue. Look at the shooting in Buffalo New York, the perpetrator of that crime apologized in court and wishes that they had had a mental health intervention or program that could have helped them before they killed those people. Putting roadblocks in the way of someone getting a gun is just delaying the inevitable if someone is determined to cause harm. Taking a proactive mental healthcare approach will stop individuals from wanting to cause harm in the first place. In Waukesha Wi a man used a car as a weapon to kill parade goers by running them over. Access to firearms wasn't an issue here but mental health interventions at some point in this man's life surely would have helped. This is the common thread that ties all of these horrible occurrences together. Access and availability of firearms has decreased with every law that is passed but it does nothing to stem the problem. The shooter in the Oxford highschool shooting was in the school councilors office with a piece of paper that showed how in distress this young man was. Nobody wants to say that the mental health system miserably failed this young child and could have prevented this terrible tragedy. Multiple gun laws were broken that day in Oxford but none of them including new ones that are being discussed now would have stopped someone intent on causing harm. What may stop it in the future would be mental health interventions at the appropriate time. I truly believe that new gun legislation will do nothing to stop mass casualty events, it will only serve to criminalize otherwise law abiding citizens. Please take a step back and really look at what solutions  will help with the problem of mass violence and try to implement those. Thank you for taking the time to read this email and I look forward to a reply.

"2023-03-07",1678225866,"March Madness: A Primer on Collegiate League of Legends, Part 1: The North Conference","Its every college basketballs favorite time of year, which coincidentally also makes it nearly time for the Collegiate League of Legends College Championship. If youve never followed the collegiate scene, youre in the right place to start. If youve watched previous years, youre also in the right place to start because Riot made some major format changes this year. This primer will walk through the new format and give thoughts on some of the teams in the North Conference as we enter the final week of regular season play. 





# Conference Format





While most collegiate sports teams are affiliated with regional (or not so regional, thanks B1G) conference, most league of legends teams dont get the same level of institutional support, so most teams are assigned to massive regional conferences, while the conference that support esports have special partner conferences their teams play in instead. For the past few years, these regional conferences used a 6 round Swiss pairing system to qualify for playoffs. It was simple, go 5-1 and better and make playoffs. However, this system was flawed in that it caused most teams to only have one or two series that actually mattered. The top seeds with Challenger and GM players spent four weeks smacking gold and silvers around until the last two rounds. It also meant that one off day or week could tank your entire season. This year, they changed the format by introducing the Championship and Open conferences. 





At the beginning of the year, the top 32 teams from each conference were placed in the Championship division (no team under seed 32 had ever qualified for the national championship), which removed a lot of the low-quality matchups. Then, each conference was divided into 4 groups of 8 and each team would play each other team in their group once. Instead of needing a 5-1 record, each team now just needed to place top half in their group to qualify for the 16 team playoff. 





The second piece of the season is the 14 partner conferences. These range from just 5 teams to 20 and have their own formats for regular season play, which Ill discuss more in detail in a different post. 





# Qualification for the College Championship





Qualification for the College Championship occurs from each conferences playoffs. Based on past performance, each regional and partner conference is allotted a number of seeds that go to their highest placing teams. This ranges from 4 seeds for the south conference to just 1 for the west. When totaled up, there are 26 directly qualifying bids to the College Championship, leaving 6 open bids that are assigned by selection after playoffs are complete.





# North Conference





Now that all the boring format stuff is out of the way we can get to the results. Currently, its the beginning of week 7 of the regular season, so we have a solid idea of how most groups will play out and a great idea of which teams might be dark horses going into playoffs. 





While the South conference has won the past two years, the North conference ranked as the number two conference and receives three championship bids. That being said, Maryville University won the title in 2019 and 2017 and is almost certainly the strongest program as a whole. Additionally, the North conference had two top 8 teams in 2022 and 3 in 2021 and had more select bids to the tourney than any other conference. Basically, the North conference has the largest selection of quality programs in the country, even if they havent gone all the way in the past few years. 





# Favorites





To start out this section we have **Maryville University (1 seed, Group A)**, the perennial contender from St. Louis coming in as the number 1 overall seed nationally. Maryvilles worst placement since 2017 was a 5-8th place finish in 2018. Outside that, they have two titles, a runner-up, and a 3-4th finish. Theyve won the North conference every year since its inception, are currently 6-0 in matches with zero games lost, and have LCS/NACL veteran Niles in the top lane. Their most recent tournament finish is as the best team on the amateur circuit with a 3-1 victory in the most recent proving grounds. Indisputably the best team in the conference, every team thats in this conference is praying they avoid the 8 and 9 seeds in playoffs because an early matchup against Maryville will almost certainly end their season. 





Out of the top four seeds, the only other remaining undefeated team is **Saint Louis University (3 seed, C)**, and although they dropped one worrying game to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, this roster has nearly as much experience as Maryville. With players Airren, SkyTec, and Winnie playing for AOE Gold and CLG Faith in the NACL this year, it feels like theyre a shoe-in for one of the three seeds for this conference. However, thus far SLU has avoided playing the other top team in their conference, so tune in this weekend to see if they can take down **Illinois State (6)**.





The other notable top team in this division is **Bethany Lutheran (5 seed, D)**, currently sitting atop their group with a 6-0 record. Like SLU, they have one game loss, to **University of Iowa (13)**. Bethany has been to the College Championship the past two years, making semifinals in 2021 but being upset in the ro32 by Converse University in 2022 (who went on to make semis). Like SLU, this team has yet to face what should be their greatest challenge, **Michigan State (4)**, who they will face this weekend. 





# Dark Horses





It may seem strange to place two undefeated teams divided by only two seeds in separate categories here, but when you looked at **Northwood Universitys (7 seed, B)** history, its clear why. The Northwood Timberwolves have never qualified for a conference playoffs, though they finished with a 4-2 record in 2021. Last year they ended 1-5, but this year they had 100% roster turnover and have been sweeping through their group to start with a 6-0 record and zero game losses. While Northwood has not seen any success in League of Legends prior to this year, they placed first in the recent Valorant North Conference and winning the Red Bull Valorant World Championship in Brazil last December, so they are a respected esports program. However, the Timberwolves have yet to play the top seed in their group, **THE Ohio State University (2)**, so tune in this weekend to see the result there. 





If youre an observant reader, you may have noticed a lack of top team matchups up to this point in the writeup, and you may have also noticed multiple high seeds missing from the favorites categories. These next three teams are the reason why. 





First up is the **University of Iowa (13 seed, D)**, sitting at a 6-1 record with five game losses. Though they played in a playoff series as part of the Big Ten Esports Conference before it went defunct, Iowa has never played in a regional conference playoff. Iowa started the season hot, beating **Michigan State (4)** in a close 2-1 series in the first week, being the only double-digit seed across all four regional conferences to upset a single-digit seed that week, much less a top 4 seed. After their hot start, Iowa dropped individual games to both **University of Chicago (20)** and **Truman State (29)**, a worrying trend for anyone who wants to compete for a College Championship bid. However, they played their way back to the dark horse list with a 1-2 loss to **Bethany Lutheran (5)**, showing they can still compete with the best. Iowa has already completed their final series and is locked into a seed somewhere between 4 and 9 in playoffs depending on the outcome of this weeks games. 





The second major upset of this region came from **Purdue University (15 seed, B)**, who upset **THE Ohio State University (2)** in a 2-1 victory and sits at a 5-2 record with five game losses. Purdue has made the North Conference playoffs twice and the college championship once in 2021 but failed to qualify for playoffs last year. Additionally, theyve matches lost to **Northwood (7)**, and in-state rivals **Indiana University (23)**. Its also important to note that Ohio State was missing their starting mid for the upset. Still, an upset over a 2 seed makes this a team that no 5-8 seed wants to be matched against in the first round of playoffs. 





Our final double-digit seed upset comes from **University of Kansas (11 seed, C)**. As far as my research took me, I found Kansas hadnt made a regional playoff, just like Northwood and Iowa. Despite losing to **University of Cincinnati (14)**, and **Saint Louis University (3)**, Kansas managed to take down powerhouse **Illinois State (6)** to cement their place in the playoffs. 





When initially writing this article, I had **THE Ohio State University (2 seed, B)** in the faltering powerhouses section, then I moved them to favorite when I realized their only match loss was with a sub mid, then I moved them to dark horses when I realized that this team has never achieved any competitive success and they look underwhelming with a loss to **Purdue (15)**. But while Ohio State has never achieved anything, the same cant be said about their mid 5fire. For those of you who follow the amateur scene, that name should immediately make you pay attention. While 5fire hasnt put up incredible numbers thus far in collegiate, you cant ignore the fact that he won every amateur tournament he attended in 2021, including winning Spring Proving grounds, where his team beat teams like C9 Academy with Darshan, 100T Academy with Tenacity, Luger, Kenvi, and Poome, and GGS Academy with Chime. Of course, 





# Faltering Powerhouses





Finally we get to those missing 1-8 seeds that youve seen mentioned in the Dark Horses section. Despite losing matches to double-digit seeds, these teams are both historical powerhouses that are going to scare some top half seeds in the first round of playoffs. 





First is **Michigan State (4 seed, D)**. Despite losing to **Iowa (13)** early on, theyve won 5 matches in a row, dropping individual games to **Iowa State (12)** and **UChicago (20)**. Michigan State placed top 8 at last years College Championship, but lost their jungler to Northwood and top and support to amateur teams. Still, two returning national quarterfinalists form a strong core and should this team beat **Bethany Lutheran (5)** this weekend, theyll shoot right back up this list. 





Lastly, we have **Illinois State (6 seed, C)**. Like Michigan State, this is a team that has historically been very strong. They placed top 16 last year and top 8 the year before and play in more tournaments than any team on this list barring Maryville. Unfortunately, the stats for the match against Kansas arent available on the CLol website, so we dont know if they were playing with any subs. Still, Illinois State has the talent and experience to make a deep run, and if they beat **Saint Louis University (3)** this weekend theyll shoot right back up. 





That sums up the North Conference. Let me know if you prefer these writeups to be formatted by frontrunners/dark horses like I did with this post or give a group-by-group rundown in the future. I plan on posting one of these a day until this weekend then posting links to streams on Saturday, then doing a follow up before playoffs next week.","leagueoflegends",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11lckjl/march_madness_a_primer_on_collegiate_league_of/",2023-03-07 21:51:06

"2023-02-18",1676689535,"Am I wrong in thinking the Witnesses can be truly disgusting?","On Monday night -- 13 Feb. -- there was a shooting at Michigan State University, leaving eight casualties: five wounded, three dead (four if you include the shooter that discharged his 9 mm. on himself around midnight).





The next day was dedicated as an improvisatory memorial service, collectivizing flowers, prayers, and plastic candles near a rock with the names of the three dead -- all undergraduate students under 21 years of age -- painted on it. The entire time though, the Witnesses were there (I personally conferred with at least three), and I swear they seemed to be the closest to smiling in the midst of mournful faces, passing cards and literature for the passersby to learn more about the Bible, despite the diversity of faiths already being practiced at that moment to ease the sudden grief -- and what can be said to them other than that their religions are false and will be destroyed come Armageddon? Their very presence there, with the express purpose of only evangelizing, seemed only to beget stress in addition to that dolorous day.





The shooting started at the Union building -- I was actually there to harmonize the hold on my student account, albeit leaving two hours before any homicides. Since it is clear that the Witnesses are willing to instrumentalize such a tragedy as a means of promulgating their ministry, I was left wondering the whole week that were I to also die that day, how much could I rely on the Witnesses to exploit the execrable circumstances that would have led to my being shot to death -- it's as if they favor their faith more than physical flesh! -- or, if I was approved as a pioneer (I was never actually baptized), that I would have to preach Scripture in a similar fashion.





I was studying to be a Witness for years at this point for the sake of certain members of my family -- I was reconsidering the whole time, but this might just be the push off the precipice. Would I be wrong in concluding that? That this truly was a disgusting stunt for the Witnesses to pull?","exjw",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1155abu/am_i_wrong_in_thinking_the_witnesses_can_be_truly/",2023-02-18 03:05:35

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.





Some people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.





I watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped themselves, at the end.

### Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State





While Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State. Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion for the next names up.





I thought throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes, and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three  although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball through a big hit.





Obviously Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown, including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day. However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly on multiple occasions.

### Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane





Unless youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked 1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over 1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the Year.





Spears was the biggest winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut schemes the second practice.





More importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden, where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched the ball during full team period.





Still, Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

### Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State





Now combining the running back position and the school I started with in Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021, Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team All-Mountain West accolades.





While his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he simply didnt lose many reps.





In team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions. That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards) early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

### Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty





Just a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish, losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the air as the next four players combined.





The first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one, because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a window for the ball to arrive.





Douglas made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was voted the WR of the Week for that side.

&amp;#x200B;





### Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford





This guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again big-time during Senior Bowl week.





There were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running. Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back to the QB.





Along with the way he was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline, after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action, where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

### Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State





These all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular. Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards in each of them.





Day one, this guy kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on. Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by DBs untouched basically.





During team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro, he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually during those drills.

&amp;#x200B;





### Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State





Now, on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11 passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.





When you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple of steps on the DB.





However, hed also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the 16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

### Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland





I had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all but three of his final 42 games.





Athleticism was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback. His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never lined up at Maryland.





With that being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order to create movement in the run game on top of that.

### Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA





I had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C. States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league coaches.





We had a lot of powerful interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones, and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was able to ride that guy past the QB.





I dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos, to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340 pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that, he was named the West IOL of the Week.

### Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota





Its not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the country this past season.





Everything this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once looping around towards the center.





During team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each, and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one of them.

### Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State





I really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall, Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier, but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for 33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes batted down at the line.





The question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at 342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.





Watching him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

### Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia





This has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to first-team all-conference the latter two years.





After lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give him ground.





Yet, Stills mightve been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him, to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through, trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting another one on the last defensive play for the East.

### Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin





Unlike the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned. Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10) and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.





Since I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.





In run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display, winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside. Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his effort chasing away from the play.

### Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee





A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer to an early day three prospect.





And what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage. During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck for the interception.





In team run drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his hands, to slither around them.

&amp;#x200B;





### Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State





While I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety, outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.





After showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside, you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two, once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.





On top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen  not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly. Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine invite.

### Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina





A position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two sacks across his two seasons there.

This is one of the best courses of action that we have at the moment, so please make your voices heard!





Edit: Here is my email, I attempted to take a very centrist stance in hopes of pulling more democrats closer to the center.





 





Hello,





I hope you are all doing well. I am  a very concerned lifetime Michigan resident and gun owner, so I wanted  to take the time to write to you all in hopes that I can sway at least  one of you towards proposing bills that will actually make a difference  in Michigan.   








The three initial gun control  bills proposed (red flag laws, safe storage laws, and ""universal""  background checks) unfortunately will do nothing to address the state of  crime and mass shootings anywhere in the country, let alone Michigan.  The tragedies that occurred at Oxford High School and Michigan State  University would not have been prevented if these laws were already on  the books. The Oxford shooter was a mentally ill child who was handed a  weapon by his negligent parents who deserve punishment just as severe as  the shooter himself, and the MSU shooter was a criminal who was  supposed to have felony charges on his record but did not due to a lapse  in judgement by county officials years back. How would any of these  laws have changed anything? Safely storing firearms is a practice that  the vast majority of responsible gun owners already perform and is a  simply unenforceable law unless certain rights are to be waived. Red  flag laws are a direct infringement upon one's constitutional right to  due process, to say the very least, and open the door to abuse via  racial profiling and retaliation, among others. Universal background  checks simply do not make sense because we already have a background  check system when purchasing firearms from an FFL dealer, and firearms  that are traded/purchased between **legal and responsible** gun  owners are rarely the issue, it is typically criminals and criminal  transactions that need the proper attention from law enforcement. We  face a list of unique problems in Michigan, none of which will be  addressed by the proposition of this legislation.





Further  legislation that is being pushed, namely legislation that makes it  almost impossible for CPL holders to carry their firearms anywhere, will  only serve to worsen one of the primary issues we face; crime.  Furthermore, laws like this will disproportionately affect minorities  and those living in lower to middle class areas, where **legally**  concealing a firearm is essential to one's safety. These areas have  little to no police presence due to a lack of funding, overextension, or  most commonly both. As the child of an immigrant I have first hand  exposure to these areas of Michigan, as I was born and raised in Metro  Detroit and have experienced just how dangerous some areas can be.  Proposing bills to make it more difficult for **legal and responsible** gun  owners to purchase and carry firearms is a massive step in the wrong  direction, seeing as the vast majority of these legal gun owners are  unable to afford private security teams adequately armed to protect them  and their families whenever and wherever necessary.





If  the Michigan legislature wishes to pass legislation that will actually  make a difference in the state, especially concerning the topic of gun  crime, perhaps a great place to start would be to tackle the poverty  issue our state faces. Our metropolitan areas, namely cities like  Detroit and Flint, are among the most dangerous cities in the country.  I've unfortunately witnessed schools that were boarded up and closed in  Detroit, a lack of resources for the community, a lack of community  centers to help the children and provide outside of school education and  care, a lack of nutritional food choices, a lack of proper healthcare  both mental and physical, a lack of proper infrastructure, and more that  I am probably forgetting at the moment. Myself along with many others  have heard so many politicians claiming to be champions of the poor and  disenfranchised, including our current governor, but we have yet to see  any real change at the very source, at the root of our issues in this  state. The intense focus on ""gun control"" is posturing at the very  least, unconstitutional and treasonous at most especially when there are  so many other areas that we need to shift the focus to.





We  have unique issues here in Michigan, the improper flow of taxpayer  funds and corporate backed politicians topping the list. The laws  proposed would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the tragedies  that occurred, and will most likely do nothing to prevent any future  tragedies should they occur. There are steps you could all take to  tackle the root of the issue, regardless of party.





I  implore you all to set your party aside and rethink the proposed bills,  for the sake of this state and its people, and propose bills that will  actually make a difference in Michigan from the ground up.





Thank you,

Apparently, they used ChatGPT to write a condolence email after the recent tragic shooting at Michigan State University, and it ended up sounding like a robot with a heart of steel.





The email talked about the importance of creating inclusive environments and taking care of each other, but it was as cold as a robot's circuits. And that's because it was! At the bottom of the email, they even admitted that it was paraphrased from ChatGPT. Oops.

Hi, I'm a freshman currently at Michigan State University, and two weeks ago, a gunman came onto campus and shot up two different buildings, killing three people and hospitalizing five.  I was about two buildings away from the shooting when it started, meaning that I heard the shots, screams, and sirens.  For four hours I hid in my closet, crying on the phone with my parents and sister.  I was never in any real danger past the first moments (I was close enough for stray bullets to theoretically be a concern), but the police scanners we were all listening to made it seem like there were multiple shooters in all parts of campus.  We thought it was a mass terrorism event, and I had to come to terms with the fact that the police were saying that there was a shooter on the same floor of the same building as some of my friends.  I didn't know if I was ever going to see them again or even get to come home.





Two weeks on, I can't think.  I feel like a fog has settled over my brain.  I have a hard time typing out sentences, let alone doing advanced math or writing a paper.  Any assignment feels overwhelming, but I can't take a break from school because I will lose my scholarship.  I'm in therapy, but there's only so much you can do on a zoom call that's not technically even supposed to be happening because you're out of state.  I shake uncontrollably at random times and can't watch a lot of the shows that I like because they have gun violence and sirens in them.  I can't stop thinking about the what ifs and whys (why wasn't it me, it could have been me). I have to bike past the places where people died every day.  I just want everything to stop, but everything has to keep going because other people have lives too.





I guess my question is how do I even start to heal?  I've looked into trauma therapy, but there's so much discourse on whether or not things like EMDR even work that I can't sift through it all.  Our psych services are overloaded with traumatized kids, so that's a no-go.  My profs are super nice and are giving grace on assignments, but if this lasts for more than two weeks more (after spring break), I'm not sure if that will be the case anymore.  I can't take a semester off because I'm only here on scholarship and that goes away if I drop.  I can't just stop my classes because I need grad school.  I can't go home early because I have a lab job that people need me to do, and if I somehow can swing it, then I'm just miserable in another state.  I feel like my life has been ripped away from me.  My parents keep telling me that I've gotta move on, and while I know they're right, it feels like telling someone they have to finish a marathon while that person is stuck in quicksand.  I'm mentally exhausted and everyone knows it.  How do I even start to put my life back together again?","traumatoolbox",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/11dp7jq/how_do_i_even_start_to_heal/",2023-02-27 22:40:17

He and I have never seen eye to eye on gun laws and Im ashamed to say it has affected our relationship. I live in Connecticut and was 10 when the Sandy Hook shooting took place and ever since that day I have been a strong believer in stricter gun laws. We have very different political beliefs (he is very conservative, I am more to the left) and over the past 6 years we have drifted apart because of this. Whenever a piece of political media was playing near us we would always get into an argument and end up not talking for a day or two. I know how childish that sounds and he and I have tried to overcome our differences but our need to be right would ultimately take over.





Our last major argument was over the Robb Elementary school shooting in Ulvade, Texas last year. I was mad at the response of the police but he defended their actions and said if he was there he would have followed the same procedures. We did not speak for over two months and it hurt me because he is honestly an amazing father. He raised my brother and I as a single parent and worked long hours as a plumber and union worker to provide for us. I tried to reach out to him a couple months later but we have barely spoken since that day. I know, that is a bad way to communicate and we are working on it.





This morning he called me before I went to class to check in. He sounded emotional and said the shooting at Michigan State University last night was really affecting him. He was born in Michigan so he knows people who live in Lansing, Michigan where the campus is located. He told me he was canceling his NRA membership and said he would be open to learning about tighter gun control laws. He is tired of children dying and no longer wants to support a group of people who have shown their willingness to put guns before people.





He finished by saying I love you my daughter which made me break down. I said I love you back and apologized for the arguments and words I used. I made a promise to hear his side before responding and we both agreed to start repairing our relationship. I hope he is serious about this. I feel like I do not have a right to change his beliefs but all I want is for him to understand the other side of these debates. I have to work on this myself but I hope we can grow together.

Lawmakers across the country have filed hundreds of pieces of anti-transgender legislation for the 2023 session, setting out to further marginalize a community of people who already faced a year of unprecedented violence and threats to their existence.





While the media often portrays the anti-LGBTQ+ mission of Americas rightwing elements as part of a culture war, some members of the community, allies, and activists argue that it is best described as a (state) government-sponsored genocidefar from a nebulous battle of ideas and values. Depending on what state one lives in, various expressions of LGBTQ+ identity are actively being legislated out of existence and criminalized. Transgender individuals, in particular, are being stripped of rights at an alarming rate by lawmakers beholden to rightwing propaganda campaigns. Working in concerteither intentionally or unintentionallywith far-right extremists, this combination amounts to a coordinated attempt to eradicate the transgender community from wide swaths of the nation.





#Gender affirming care





*Definition: Gender-affirming care is a model of care which includes a spectrum of social, psychological, behavioral or medical (including hormonal treatment or surgery) interventions designed to support and affirm an individuals gender identity.*





One of the strongest examples of how anti-transgender laws can be considered a form of genocide are bills that ban gender affirming care. Pay special attention to part (b) in the following definition:





The United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide [defines](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) genocide as any acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; **(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group**; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.





Legislators in 37 states have filed bills that prohibit gender affirming care in various forms and for various age groups. If successful, their states will join the [four](https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/youth-access-to-gender-affirming-care-the-federal-and-state-policy-landscape/) that previously banned gender affirming care for minors.





These laws can be seen as causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, given that gender-affirming care for transgender youth is [proven](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789423) to reduce odds of suicidality by 73%, according to one study. 





* [Bauer, et al., 2015](http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2): ...interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations.





* [McNeil, et al., 2012](https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/trans_mh_study.pdf): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition.





* [de Vries, et al., 2014](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/134/4/696/32932/Young-Adult-Psychological-Outcome-After-Puberty?redirectedFrom=fulltext): A clinical protocol of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals, physicians, and surgeons, including puberty suppression, followed by cross-sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery, provides gender dysphoric youth who seek gender reassignment from early puberty on, the opportunity to develop into well-functioning young adults&After gender reassignment, in young adulthood, the [gender dysphoria] was alleviated and psychological functioning had steadily improved. Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population. Improvements in psychological functioning were positively correlated with postsurgical subjective well-being.





Prohibiting or criminalizing the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria will manufacture more suicides within the transgender community. Thus, by blocking life-saving healthcare, these policies cause serious bodily or mental harm to members of the transgender and non-binary community.





Furthermore, by banning gender-affirming treatmentin some cases far into adulthoodlegislators are attempting to erase transgender individuals from existence. Not only will transgender people be prevented from accessing safe healthcare, but those who fall in the prohibited age range will also be forced to [de-transition](https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvm9a8/south-dakota-to-force-trans-kids-to-detransition-ban-gender-affirming-care?utm_source=reddit.com). 





&gt;Already, transgender youth who are not allowed to transition attempt suicide at a much higher rate, wrote transgender activist Erin Reed in her newsletter. Medical detransition will mean extremely distressing changes for trans youth, many of whom have lived as their gender for most of their lives& This is particularly cruel to transgender kids who have been receiving care for a long time and who are known as their gender by all of the peers and adults in their lives.





* Oklahoma [Senate Bill 129](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314/Oklahoma-2023-SB129-Introduced.pdf) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Carolina [House Bill 3730](https://legiscan.com/SC/text/H3730/id/2647692/South_Carolina-2023-H3730-Introduced.html) would ban individuals under the age of 26 from accessing gender affirming healthcare.





* South Dakota [House Bill 1080](https://sdlegislature.gov/Session/Bill/24100/249156) is unique in not only banning gender affirming care for minors, but also ordering physicians to medically detransition trans youth in their care within the year.





* Among other states considering bills to ban gender affirming care for minors, Oklahoma leads with 32, followed by Missouri with 31, Texas with 28, Mississippi with 24, and Tennessee with 20just a month into the 2023 legislative session.





#Child Abuse





Part (e) of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. At first glance, this may not seem to apply in the United States. However, several states are in the process of initiating laws that would charge parents of transgender children with child abuse for providing gender affirming healthcare to their kids. This would allow a judge to order the child taken from the parents custody, as first threatened by Texas officials.





In Spring 2022, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) issued an order directing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to investigate gender-affirming medical care as child abuse. Had his directive not been [blocked](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/16/texas-trans-teens-investigation-child-abuse/) by the courts, it would have resulted in transgender and non-binary children being taken from their families and placed in the states [underfunded](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/12/texas-foster-care-system-fines/) foster system. 





&gt;[Child Welfare League of America](https://www.cwla.org/child-welfare-league-of-america-opposes-redefining-child-abuse-to-include-gender-affirming-care/): Providing appropriate, compassionate medical care for your child is not child abuse. We know that youth who identify as LGBTQ are at greater risk of homelessness, substance use disorders, mental illness, suicide ideation and attempts, trauma, and other negative outcomes than their peers; the right to receive individualized, evidence-based, identity-affirming care from their doctors and other medical providers saves lives. With nearly 30,000 children in care in 2021, Texas DFPS needs to focus its limited resources protecting children from actual abuse and neglect, not investigating children and families who are vulnerable.





Other states have attempted to pass legislation copying Abbotts strategy of removing transgender minors from their parents custody through child abuse charges. 





* In October, Michigan state Reps. Ryan Berman, Steve Carra, Luke Meerman, Beau LaFave, and Steve Marinoall Republicansintroduced [a bill](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2021-2022/billintroduced/House/pdf/2022-HIB-6454.pdf) that would charge parents with first-degree child abuse for obtaining a gender transition procedure for their child. 





* Tennessees state senate recently passed [Senate Bill 1](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0001/id/2612108/Tennessee-2023-SB0001-Draft.pdf), which criminalizes parents who help their children obtain gender affirming careeven when they travel out of state to do so.





* Texas lawmakers introduced [House Bill 672](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/HB672/id/2612747/Texas-2023-HB672-Introduced.html) to formalize Gov. Abbotts child abuse directive. If this bill were to become law, parents who consent to gender affirming care would be engaging in conduct that places a child in imminent danger.





* Wyomings state senate passed [Senate File 111](https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2023/SF0111) to criminalize parents who consent to gender affirming care for their child. The same week, Wyoming lawmakers [killed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/02/wyoming-gop-defends-child-marriage-while-claiming-its-trans-rights-that-harm-children/) a bill to raise the legal marriage age to 18 years oldmeaning, 16 is old enough to marry but not old enough to obtain life-saving gender affirming healthcare.

#Stages of genocide





Another way of thinking of genocides is the progression of events that lead up to the mass killing of victims. Gregory Stanton, a professor of genocidal studies and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a list of [ten stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_stages_of_genocide) that can predict a genocide. His model is based on the [Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the [Rwandan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide), and the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide). 





Some stages fit what were seeing in the U.S. with LGBTQ+ rights better than others. This is to be expected, as the oppression of the community isnt an organized nationwide phenomenon. Instead, certain states are chipping away at the rights of transgender and non-binary people incrementally, while other states increase protections for the LGBTQ+ community.





The stages that most clearly fit the current situation are related to media and propaganda: namely, the Classification and Dehumanization phases. These two stages in particular work in concert to give Americans permission to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals.





##Classification





Definition: Division of us and them





Example: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi





Rightwing media has played a large role in creating stigma and delegitimizing LGBTQ+ individuals.





These rightwing campaigns have real legal consequences for transgender individuals. For example, a female student was assaulted by a male student in a skirt in a Loudoun County, Virginia, school bathroom. Rightwing media outlets like The Daily Wire and Fox News [portrayed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-virginia-loudoun-county-bathroom-assault-transgender_n_61784469e4b093143210f8d6) the attack as a result of trans-inclusive bathroom policies. In truth, however, the policies were not approved until months after the assault. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) then [forced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/16/trans-students-virginia-bathroom-sports/) schools to ban transgender students from using bathrooms associated with their preferred gender. 





Laws and regulations that deny access to public toilets by gender identity send the message that transgender people are somehow dangerous and need to be swept into segregated spaces. Nine states have introduced bathroom bills so far this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota.





##Dehumanization





Definition: One group denies the humanity of the other group





Example: the Nazis referred to Jews as vermin





During this stage, the dominant power vilifies the targeted group, often using media to spread propaganda. The clearest and most dangerous example is the recent rightwing branding of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies as groomers and pedophiles. The tactic was used against [Disney](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88g3ep/anti-grooming-rally-at-disney-is-latest-stop-for-culture-war-traveling-circus) for the companys opposition to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Dont Say Gay bill; [schools and libraries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/23/drag-queen-story-hour/)) that host Drag Queen Story Hour events; and [hospitals](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/08/17/boston-childrens-united-states-hospitals-transgender-health-care/10353020002/) that provide gender affirming care to minors. 





The demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals and allies would not be possible without the cooperation of media outlets like Fox News. In a three-week period from March to April 2022, Fox News ran [170 segments](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/doom-groom-fox-news-has-aired-170-segments-discussing-trans-people-past-three-weeks) on trans people, throughout which the network ""repeatedly invoked the long-debunked myth that trans people pose a threat to minors and seek to groom them. The vilifying and dehumanizing language used by hosts like Tucker Carlson works to incite violence against the LGBTQ+ community, inspiring self-invented heroes to avenge the imaginary harm to children they have been told is happening. 





Unstable individuals watching the biggest cable news show in America can thus be inspired towards threats and violence. We saw this when Carlson [amplified](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-responded-threats-against-childrens-hospitals-amplifying-voices-fueling-them) false claims against childrens hospitals for performing hysterectomies for trans youth (which, to be clear, was not true); the hospitals were then inundated with bomb threats.





After a full year of disseminating hate speech and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, Carlson acted [baffled](https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1594859239553765377?s=20) as to why a man would shoot up an LGBTQ+ club in Colorado, [adding](https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/11/23/fox-host-says-no-link-between-club-q-shooting-hate-speech/) that the tragedy was being used as a pretext to censor rightwing speech. 





&gt;These horrifying murders in Colorado over the weekend quickly became a pretext for yet more censorship of your speech, Carlson said. You are responsible for this, they told you, because you said the wrong thing.





&gt;Carlson then accused the groups and individuals that he said were calling for censorship  in this case, the LGBTQ community and its allies  of engaging in, perpetuating, or suborning the genital mutilation and sexual abuse and exploitation of children.





Days later, Carlson had the founder of anti-trans group Gays Against Groomers on his show to [declare](https://www.thedailybeast.com/tucker-carlson-guest-says-attacks-like-club-q-wont-stop-until-we-end-this-evil-agenda?via=twitter_page) that killing LGBTQ+ individuals would not stop until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children. 





###Drag performances





Rightwing media campaigns to smear drag queens for [sexualizing](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/la-zoo-sexualizing-kids-family-friend-drag-shows) children delegitimize a valid form of artistic expression and cast performers as a danger to society, [comparing](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-says-drag-queens-are-part-plot-normalize-pedophilia) them to a category of criminal most likely to evoke revulsion and violence: pedophiles. 





Republican lawmakers followed these cues, introducing 30 bills so far this year to limit or outright ban drag performances. The worst of this legislation is phrased vaguely enough to allow the criminalization of transgender people just for existing in public spaces.





* [Montana House Bill 359](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB359/id/2672749/Montana-2023-HB359-Introduced.pdf) defines drag as ""exhibit[ing] a gender identity that is different than the performer's gender assigned at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers and sings, lip syncs, dances, or otherwise performs for entertainment to appeal to a prurient interest. Prurient means having or encouraging an excessive interest in sexual matters. Any business that hosts a drag performance is categorized as a sexually oriented business and may not allow a minor on its premises. Furthermore, the bill prohibits schools or libraries that receive state funding from hosting drag performances, like drag queen story hour events.





* The Tennessee Senate passed [SB 3](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/SB0003/id/2657437/Tennessee-2023-SB0003-Draft.pdf) last week, which declares that ""male [and] female impersonators"" are in the same prurient category as strippers. As currently worded, SB 3 would make being a male or female impersonatorsomething that could include simply existing as a transgender or non-binary personon public property or in view of a minor a crime.





* [West Virginia Senate Bill 253](http://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_text.cfm?billdoc=sb253%20intr.htm&amp;yr=2023&amp;sesstype=RS&amp;i=253) makes it a crime for male or female impersonators to perform where they could be viewed by a person who is a minor, regardless of whether or not performed for consideration. The phrasing obviously allows transgender and non-binary individuals to be criminally charged for existing in any location where a child could potentially be present.","Keep_Track",93,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/114slfh/states_move_to_criminalize_transgender_people_for/",2023-02-17 17:35:02

Dear white Americans,





I come before you with bowed head, heavy heart, and a long-overdue apology.





Im sorry for doubting you, for wrongly assuming you were turning a blind eye to gun violence, outside of offering up thoughts and prayers after every high-profile shooting, because it was disproportionately hurting people who wear dark skin like I do.





I was wrong. I know now your indifference had nothing, or very little, to do with race. You just dont care, or more charitably, you care more about a cartoonish version of the Second Amendment, one that has convinced the majority of the residents of the most-prosperous nation Earth has ever known that tens of thousands of bullet-riddled bodies every year  in the form of murder and homicide and suicide and preventable accidents  is a reasonable price for our freedom.





Im writing this apology in the wake of yet another mass shooting at yet another school, this time at Michigan State University. But, lets be honest. The details dont much matter, neither does the location, something you made clear with your reaction to the slaughter of little white boys and little white girls at Sandy Hook a decade ago and white men and white women six years ago at a concert in Las Vegas. That this keeps happening in the U.S. on a level it doesnt happen anywhere else in the industrialized world says loudly and profoundly that this is what you want.





And to think, I spent all those years harshly judging you for not caring about my high school friend who was blinded after being shot in the head; or my brothers girlfriend being killed in a drive-by shooting; or the young man whom I tried to mentor who ended up shot dead anyway; or the other one who was shot to death during an incident that claimed the life of a Davidson police officer in North Carolina; or the one sitting on death row in South Carolina because of his involvement in the shooting deaths of two convenience store workers in the Myrtle Beach metro area.





Each of them was black. I thought you didnt care because they were black. I thought you didnt commit to doing something serious about our sick gun culture because the victims were so often black. I thought you kept making excuses about why we couldnt unwind an untenable situation  a culture so saturated in guns weve convinced ourselves we need armed-agents of the state to enforce minor traffic violations because it isnt unreasonable for cops to assume whoever is driving isnt armed  because you didnt experience the pain of gun violence the way people who look like I do have.





Historically, race has played a role, with laws saying white men and white boys were legally obligated to enforce slave laws, to Ronald Reagan embracing gun control measures, at least for a while. And it likely still does, just not in the simplistic way I had once imagined. I get why you werent moved by Trayvon Martins killing, or at least I thought I did until you were equally unmoved by coffins filled with the bullet-riddled bodies of white children.





Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, after the latest mass shooting well treat like wallpaper, said you either care about protecting kids, or you dont. But please dont tell me you care about the safety of children if youre not willing to have a conversation about keeping them safe in a place that should be a sanctuary.





If this is not a wake-up call to do something, I dont know what is, she said.





A 21-year-old Michigan State University student took to TikTok to express her grief about the shooting as well. Shes now a survivor of two mass shootings  the first at Sandy Hook 10 years and two months ago, a fact that she says is incomprehensible.





Shes white, not black.





Again, I apologize for believing you were blinded by race or racism. I didnt realize you loved Glocks and AK-47s more than you love my kids or even your own.





I wont make that mistake again.

"2023-02-15",1676422699,"The mass shooting reading list","Reading through the comments about the shooting at Michigan State I was struck by how many people have very basic questions about what happened or how mass shootings unfold. I saw a lot of misinformation spreading that should be very obvious to anybody with a passing knowledge of these events, such as ""people are saying there are two shooters!"" (There's never a second shooter, and when there is they are with the first shooter). With that in mind I decided to put together an exhaustive (though by no means complete) guide to resources I've used to develop a pretty high degree of active shooter knowledge. Where possible I've linked the specific resources and given broad strokes outlines of why I think the particular resource is important. My hope is that this is helpful both for the lay public and for newer officers, particularly those who don't get a lot of continuing training on the material at their departments.   








A brief background. When I was an active officer I served as an ALERRT and FLETC instructor and designed my department's active shooter protocol. I still teach active shooter preparedness and training while doing a bit of mass casualty consulting and continue to serve as an infantry officer in the national guard. I also devoted a large portion of my graduate thesis to training officers for active shooters.  








Part 1





**Books**





*Columbine,* by Dave Cullen. The finest book ever written about that day, it debunks a lot of the myths that developed around Columbine. It also helps to recontextualize the idea that Columbine was a failure of law enforcement training. Columbine is better understood as a failure of law enforcement imagination, because most of what responding officers did that day was consistent with a 1999 understanding of those situations.   








*A Mother's Reckoning*, by Sue Klebold. Written by the mother of one of the Columbine shooters the book gives one of the best insights ever recorded into the life of a mass shooter. Also does a phenomenal job examining the failures of media and how the Columbine narrative become solidified after 72 hours. I've met Sue, and she is lovely. She will never forgive herself for what happened that day.  








*Why Kids Kill,* by Peter Langman, PhD. Langman, a clinical forensic psychologist, profiles ten school shooters and examines their motives. One of the key takeaways here is that mass murder is almost always an individual event motivated by different causes, even if the end result looks the same. Understanding the distinction in behavioral pattern between a terrorist and a schizophrenic or an underperforming employee looking to get even can help prevent the next killing.  








*Extreme Killing,* by James Alan Fox, PhD. The 2019 edition is updated to reflect current trends. Fox coined the term ""pseudocommando"" and does an excellent job at examining the different ways people carry out their attacks.





*QF32,* by Richard de Crespigny. De Crespigny is an Australian Air Force veteran and Qantas Airbus A380 pilot who came to fame for landing the impossibly damaged Qantas Flight 32, a feat that has yet to be replicated in flight simulators.

I don't want to say that everybody in law enforcement management before 1999 was an ignorant fool, but we all should have seen these events coming long ago. Columbine wasn't the first mass shooting, nor was it the first school shooting. Hell, it wasn't even the first in the 1990s. But it was the first time that law enforcement's failure to prepare and train appropriately for these events was documented on international television. It took fifty years from Camden to Columbine for law enforcement to make a significant shift in how we deal with active killers.

I read a similar 1997 book by Gary Lavergne two weeks before the Vegas shootings in preparation for a mass shooting preparedness course I was attending. We all agreed that the first person in the modern era to emulate Whitman would cause an unspeakable number of casualties. Unfortunately, the Vegas shooter had the same thought we did and shot six hundred something people. This comes back to the failure of imagination: mass shooters tend to study the past much more than officers do.

""We're fighting in a jungle, why do we need to prepare for house house fighting?"" is not that far off from ""we work in a wealthy suburb, why do we need to worry about mass murder?""

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially  in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous  back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to  offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.





Some  people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week  between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.





I  watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw  in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on  each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in  this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped  themselves, at the end.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State





While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.





I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.





Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane





Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.





Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.





More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.





Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State





Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.





While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.





In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty





Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.





The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.





Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford





This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.





There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.





Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State





These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.





Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.





During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State





Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.





When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.





However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland





I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.





Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.





With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA





I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.





We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.





I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota





Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.





Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.





During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State





I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.





The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.





Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia





This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.





After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.





Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin





Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.





Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.





In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee





A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.





And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.





In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State





While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.





After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.





On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina





A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season





**Team: New England Patriots**  


Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  


Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18





Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.





Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.





This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.





Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story





Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 





The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 





This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.





Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 





Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs.

#Three Quick Questions





**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**





The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.





**What the hell happened with the coaches?**





All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  


&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him





This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.





The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 





So why Patricia? Well, he was available.





**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**





Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 





Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers





Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.





**Three cheers for...**  


*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*





These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.





You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.





**Three jeers for...**  


*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*





Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.





And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  





The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.





##Highlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 





**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.





##Lowlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.





**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 





Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*





##2022 NFL Draft Recap





**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**





**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.





**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**





**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**





**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.





**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**





**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete





**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete








The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward. 





**2022 draft grade-right now (B+)**

#2022 Free Agent Review  





##Notable Additions





**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.





**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.





**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.





**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.








##Departures





**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.





**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.





**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.





**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.





**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.





**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.





**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

#Season Statistics  


*Written by SpaceGhost1992*  





**OFFENSE**

|Sacks Allowed|41|11 | 4|


|Pressures|110|*||








Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)





Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.





Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.





*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

**QUARTERBACKS**





| Quarterback Comparison | Mac Jones 2021 | Mac Jones 2022 | Bailey Zappe 2022 |


|:--|:--|:--|:--|


|Games Played|17|14|4|


|Total Yards|3801|2997|781|


|Yards/Att|7.3|6.8|8.5|

|QBR|56.9|36.2|34.5|


|Passer Rating|92.5|84.8|100.9|








Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 





Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  








I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)








In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 








Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

**WIDE RECEIVERS**

|TDs|6|3|2|1|1|





Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles. With Harris struggling to stay healthy, and having his carries cut nearly in half [(202 in 2021 to 106 in 2022)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3925347/damien-harris), Rhamondre took the helm as workhorse for the team. Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.








In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.








All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 





While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*  





##Roster Review  


Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.





##Quarterbacks





**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  





Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.





Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.


***


##Running Backs





**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.





**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.





**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.





**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.





**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.





**Damien Harris** UFA


***


##Wide Receivers





**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.





**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.





**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.





**Nelson Agholor** UFA





**Jakobi Meyers** UFA





**Matthew Slater** Re-signed





**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.





**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.





**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.





**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.





**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.





*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.


***


##Tight Ends





**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.





**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.





**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.





*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.


***


##Offensive Line





**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.





**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.





**James Ferentz** UFA





**Yodny Cajuste** RFA





**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.





**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.





**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.





**Marcus Cannon** UFA





*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).





**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.





Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 


***


##Defensive Line 





**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.





**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.





**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.





**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.





**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.


***


##Defensive Ends





**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.





**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.





**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.





*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)


***


##Linebackers and Defensive backs





Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.





Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

"2023-03-06",1678146074,"the death of Karl Heikell","11-year-old Karl Heikell lived with his sisters and parents in the small community of Centennial Heights Michigan. Centennial is near Calumet, a former UP boomtown.





On the afternoon of Halloween 1981 11-year-old Karl told his sister that he was heading out to a quote drinking party. He told his father that he was heading out on a walk. This was about 4p, sunset wouldnt happen for at least two and a half hours.





Karl would not return from his outing, whether it was to a drinking party like he told his sister, or if he went out for a walk like he told his father.





On November 1, his parents reported him missing to law enforcement. Unfortunately, police decided, as they often did during this era, that he was a runaway, they told the family not to worry, as Karl would turn up in a day or two at the family home.





On November 1, a man named Gary Olsen tells police that he knows Karl and saw him walking towards the ""BL"" home in Centennial Heights on Halloween, between 4 and 4:30PM. This lines up with what Karls family said about Karl departing around 4 or 4:30 that afternoon.





On December 2, 1981, police log a black Casio watch into evidence. The watch was found by a Centennial Heights local, on November 30, while he was walking County Road C-11A. The man noticed a watch face missing a wristband, laying in the road, on top of snow, and on the left side of the roadway.





Karl's father, Lawrence Heikell, confirmed the watch belonged to Karl. Police also note that the watch was found just east of the BL property in Centennial Heights, about 25 yards east of where the creek crosses the road if driving US-41. Ive mentioned the BL house twice now, we will get to the BL family shortly.





While weve found one of Karls belongings in an odd place  we still dont have any idea whats happened to Karl himself.





It will take almost a full year until we have some answers in Karls disappearance.





On October 2, 1982, Roger Perreault, a local bird hunter called law enforcement to report that while exploring a wooded area near Centennial Heights, he came across several articles of torn clothing. Roger along with his father, took police to the scene.





Upon arrival officers observed one pair of blue jeans, remnants of a blue and green plaid shirt, white socks with red trim, white underwear, and a blue nylon jacket. Additional searches that afternoon produced tufts of human hair, several fingernails, and a section of bone.





On October 5, officers returned to the location and found what appeared to be a femur it was discovered approximately 75 feet from the spot where the clothing was found. No further human remains linked to Karl have ever been recovered.





The remains were found approximately ½ a mile from the home Karl shared with his parents and sisters.





Which leads us to one of the known suspects in Karls case. AP.  AP grew up in Centennial Heights and remained in the area as an adult. In fact, he was employed by Karls uncle at Mr. Radiator in Calumet at the time of Karls disappearance.





AP knew Karl and likely knew the entire Heikell family. AP was a quiet and reserved person who had few friends. He was also a drinker, and was known to be a bad drinker, becoming loud and obnoxious. Those familiar with him and his drinking habits reported that alcohol turned him into a different person.





On Halloween night 1981 AP was with his friend, John and they were unloading a truck in Calumet around 6p. When they finished unloading the truck, John stopped in at Harters party (convenience) store on Pine Street where he saw and spoke with Karl Heikell.





Police believe this sighting of Karl to be credible. AP was drinking at a local watering hole just two doors down from Harter's at the time John saw Karl.





In a November 10, 1984, police interview, AP advised that he did know Karl and had spoken to him on several occasions. He claims he never hung out with Karl, never took him anywhere in a vehicle, and never supplied Karl with alcohol or drugs. He advised that it was his own feeling that Karls disappearance involved foul play.





Also, AP admitted to sexually abusing his own sons. He claims that his last contact with the boys was when the divorce was finalized, and since that time, says there have been no more ""incidents"" involving children.





During the 11-10-84 interview, AP stated that he had nothing to do with Karl's death, and police note that he was able to discuss the matter without being overly nervous. AP agreed to take and was administered a polygraph.





While the results are omitted from the report, a retired Calumet Post Michigan State Police Detective and former lead on the Heikell case confirmed that AP passed the exam. And I know how people feel about polygraphs, but they held a lot of sway in the early 1980s. As of early 2023 AP is still alive and resides in the Calumet area.





Another person mentioned in relation to the case is BL, a 16-year-old who was acquainted with Karl.





Police spoke with BL on November 1, 1981 16 year old BL tells police he saw Karl the afternoon of Halloween and said Karl mentioned trick or treating that night at Lake Linden.





At the end of November police again speak with BL at Calumet High School. He denied having any knowledge of where Karl is and maintained that he has not seen him since Halloween.





In the first week of December, BL's father signs a release that allows both BL and his brother, J. to be polygraphed. The tests are administered, and BL passes.





Unfortunately, there is a tragic closing to BL's story, according to reports from the Michigan State police in the summer of 1982 BL is caught by his parents with stolen property.





His father tells him that he needs to turn himself in to law enforcement. After gathering the stolen items, BL tells his father that he needs to go upstairs and get something. While upstairs in his room, BL uses a gun to shoot himself in the chest. BL died on June 28, 1982. He was 17 years old.





In 1983, all physical evidence in the disappearance and death of Karl Heikell was either released to Karls family, released to the Peterson Funeral Home, or incinerated.





The release and destruction of evidence occurred shortly after the Heikell family petitioned the Houghton County Probate Court to determine a cause of death, location of death, and time of death in order to provide some semblance of closure. If you were hoping for a DNA test on what remained of Karls clothing it cant be done. 





DNA testing on his remains to confirm that the bits of bone, nail and hair recovered were from Karl, would require an exhumation.





**So, what happened to Karl Heikell? Was it death by misadventure or a murder?**





Local librarian Dillon Geshel maintains an extensive website about the case. This write up is scratching the surface of what's available.

"2023-02-22",1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 





\-Going back to work.





The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 





\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.





From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 





\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.





In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 





However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.





The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 





This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.





\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest





With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 





Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 





I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 





I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

"2023-02-13",1676327944,"Bubble Watch","Welcome to the first edition of the 2023 College Hockey Bubble Watch! This is modeled off Eamonn Brennan's series for college basketball in The Athletic. There are three categories of teams in Bubble Watch; Locks, Should Be In, and Work to Do. Locks are any team that would still be in the field even if they lose every game left on their schedule. Should Be In are any team that would feel comfortable even if they finish poorly down the stretch, and Work to Do is any team that needs to win more games to be safely in the field of 16. Of course college hockey selects its tournament field based off the Pairwise rankings, rather than college basketball's selection committee. Odds of making the tournament are pulled from [PlayoffStatus.com](https://playoffstatus.com).  








#**Atlantic Hockey**


Since its founding in 2003, Atlantic Hockey has only had two teams in the tournament once, in 2013, when Canisius got the auto-bid and Niagara earned an at large. AIC has been the representative in the last three tournaments, but the Yellowjackets sit third at this point in the conference standings and 41st in the Pairwise. RIT leads the conference but has less than a 1% chance of earning an at-large bid. As such, nobody from AHA is on Bubble Watch and the conference will once again be represented by their tournament champion alone.  





 


#**Big Ten**  


The Big Ten has traditionally been seen as tied for the second best conference behind the NCHC, but is clearly the nation's top league this season. The conference has three locks in Minnesota, Michigan, and Penn State and six of the seven members sit in the top 16 of the Pairwise currently. Minnesota has sat at the top of the Pairwise for several weeks now and is poised to claim the top seed in the tournament. Michigan's strong non-conference scheduled buoyed their Pairwise while the Wolverines struggled in conference play, but have since rattled off seven straight wins, including a sweep over rivals Michigan State this weekend. Penn State played a very week non-conference slate, but went 10-0, bolstering their RPI and securing a spot in the field when combined with the tough Big Ten schedule.   





**Locks:** Minnesota, Michigan, Penn State  


**Should Be In:** Ohio State  


**Work to Do:** Michigan State, Notre Dame  





**Ohio State (17-11-2, PWR: 9, At Large Odds: 85%):** Ohio State collapsed last season at the end, costing themselves a tournament bid, but this year's Buckeyes are looking to avoid a similar fate. They do finish the regular season with series against Michigan and Minnesota, but Ohio State has earned splits against both earlier in the season. Earning a home Big Ten Tournament series will likely require 3-5 points.  





**Michigan State (15-15-2, PWR: 14, At Large Odds: 33%):** New coach Adam Nightingale has the Spartans in tournament contention in mid-February for the first time since the beginning of the Anastos era. Getting swept by Michigan this past weekend did not help the cause. MSU will likely need to sweep Wisconsin this upcoming weekend in their final regular season series and win a first round conference tournament series to make the field.  





**Notre Dame (14-14-4, PWR: 16, At Large Odds: 32%):** The Fighting Irish bounced back from a devastating road sweep at the hands of Michigan State to get a win and a tie against Ohio State this past weekend to get themselves back in the conversation. ND is currently the first team out of the field. Staying at .500 to maintain eligibility for an at-large bid is tantamount, but they finish their regular season in two weeks against Michigan at Yost. Getting a split is key.  








#**CCHA:**    


The sophomore season of the new CCHA doesn't have a contender for a top seed, as it did last year in Minnesota State, but it does have a chance at being a multi-bid league once again. The conference's non-conference winning percentage is down significantly from .478 to .429, damaging the RPI of the teams on the bubble.  





**Work To Do:** Michigan Tech, Minnesota State  





**Michigan Tech (21-8-4, PWR: 12, At Large Odds: 50%):** Tech has been on a tear in the last three weeks, winning five of six to keep pace with Minnesota State at the top of the CCHA standings. Non-conference wins over Michigan State in the GLI Consolation and Boston University bolster a relatively weak strength of schedule (30th) for a bubble team. The Huskies will likely need to make a run in the CCHA Tournament to earn a second straight trip to the NCAAs.  





**Minnesota State (19-10-1, PWR: 13, At Large Odds: 27%):** Coming off a devastating loss in the national championship to Denver last year, the Mavericks have not been able to quite replicate the dominance they have shown in recent seasons.  They've been good in conference play, but were swept at home by Bemidji State and Ferris State. They do have a non-conference win over Minnesota, but were swept by St. Cloud State. They are in prime position to win the CCHA once again, but will likely need to sweep, or at minimum split with, Michigan Tech to be in a good position going into the conference tournament. 








#**ECAC**  


The Ivies taking a year off continues to hurt the ECAC's strength as a conference, as only Cornell and Harvard have recovered to compete nationally. Quinnipiac, however, has dominated the conference, dropping only two games and one in non-conference to Maine and is in position to get a one seed. The Bobcats are ECAC's only lock, but they do have two other teams in contention for bids.  





**Locks:** Quinnipiac


**Should Be In:** Cornell, Harvard  





**Cornell (16-7-2, PWR: 10, At Large Odds: 72%):** The Big Red have been very good in ECAC play, but played a relatively weak non-conference schedule, though they could not have predicted Minnesota-Duluth being so average this season (they did get swept by the Bulldogs, however). They have clinched a first round bye in the ECAC tournament, thus avoiding the risk of a loss to a very bad team. Finishing the regular season undefeated (home against Clarkson and St. Lawrence, away at Brown and Yale) would go a long way, and is entirely doable.  





**Harvard (17-6-1, PWR: 11, At Large Odds: 67%):** The Crimson have their eye on a Beanpot title tonight against Northeastern, but are also in good shape for their second straight NCAA appearance. Like Cornell, they don't face any of the big dogs in the ECAC down the stretch, but losing a couple could drop Harvard from relatively safe to in danger. For now, they have a good shot of making the field.  





 


#**Hockey East:**   


Hockey East once had six teams in the projected field in the middle of December, but is now down to only two if the tournament started today. It's been a collapse that basically nobody saw coming, and saw UMass and Merrimack fall from the top 10 and top 3, respectively, to off the bubble entirely. It's still slightly possible for Merrimack, Providence, and UMass-Lowell to make the field, but their play lately does not garner any confidence that they will do so and so are not included.





**Should Be In:** Boston University   


**Work To Do:** Northeastern, UConn





**Boston University (20-7, PWR: 4, At Large Odds 61%):** The Terriers non-conference slate boasts wins over Michigan, Notre Dame, Harvard, and Cornell, and they have won 7 in a row in HEA play, but they just have too many games remaining to be a lock. BU will more than likely be in the field come Selection Saturday. This weekend's series against Merrimack could seal the deal.  





**Northeastern (14-10-4, PWR: 15, At Large Odds: 23%):** Northeastern has been good in Hockey East play, but a terrible performance in non-conference, including losses to Union, Sacred Heart, and Bentley, keep them on the edge of the tournament field. The only likely tournament team they will play down the stretch of the regular season is Harvard tonight in the Beanpot final. A win would do a great deal for their bubble hopes.  





**UConn (17-10-3, PWR: 18, At Large Odds: 14%):** One of the early darlings of the season, UConn has since fallen off a cliff. Getting swept by New Hampshire this past weekend did not help at all. The Huskies don't have any team with more than 11 wins left on their schedule and so will need to win out and pick up at least one conference tournament win to make the field.  








#**NCHC**  


The nation's best conference for the past few years is having a down year, but will have at least three, if not four bids to the tournament. Both North Dakota and Minnesota-Duluth are off the bubble for the first time in years, though Western Michigan's resurgence has somewhat made up for it.   





**Should Be In:** Denver, St. Cloud State, Western Michigan  


**Work to Do:** Nebraska-Omaha  





**Denver (23-7-0, PWR: 5, At Large Odds: 65%):** The reigning national champions are cruising in NCHC play, having been swept only once, and currently holding an eight point lead. A relatively tough non-conference schedule has the Pios in a very good position, just outside the one seeds as things stand. A series at Western Michigan in a couple weeks will likely determine if Denver is a lock or not going into the NCHC tournament.  





**St. Cloud State (18-8-2, PWR: 7, At Large Odds: 75%):** St. Cloud was great in non-conference play, but have dropped some NCHC games they shouldn't have, including to Miami and Colorado College. The Huskies finish with three series against the middle of the conference.  





**Western Michigan (19-10-1, PWR: 8, At Large Odds: 76%):** WMU boasts the most productive forward line in college hockey, which includes Hobey Baker favorite Jason Polin. A loss to Alaska-Anchorage isn't great for the resume, but they have enough NCHC wins to be safely in the field right now.  





**Nebraska-Omaha (15-10-3, PWR: 17, At Large Odds: 27%):** Omaha is used to being on the bubble in recent series and they find themselves in the thick of it again this year. They have a sweep of Western Michigan on the resume and an upcoming series against St. Cloud State that could really help their chances. Getting swept by Niagara on opening weekend is not great.  








#**Independents**


Its fairly rare that an independent has a shot at a bid, but there is one team that has one this year.  





**Work To Do:** Alaska  





**Alaska (16-10-2, PWR: 19, At Large Odds: 11%):** The Nanooks have a terrible SOS, but splits with Denver, Notre Dame, and Michigan Tech have given them a shot of making the field for only the third time ever and first since 2010. They will have to win out against Long Island, Arizona State, and Lindenwood after dropping a game to LIU this past weekend, but it is possible.","collegehockey",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/collegehockey/comments/111mb1i/bubble_watch/",2023-02-13 22:39:04

   * You need to sign up for a session to get the Zoom link.


* Online recording of MSU Webinar: [Developing Resilience in the Wake of Tragedy](https://vimeo.com/799997473/226de731e9)


   * I found it helpful for basic starting information on what is normal to be experiencing right now, answers to the immediate what do I do questions, and an idea of how to start moving forward. Theres also a Q &amp; A at the end with student questions, and it was reassuring to hear other Spartans ask about difficulties Im having as well.


   * CW: Some of the student questions at the end briefly mention where they were on campus and their experience.


* [Uwill Self-Guided Tutorial Videos](https://app.uwill.com/)


   * Free if you sign up with your MSU email


   * Short guided meditation, breathing exercise, and yoga videos.


   * Nothing specific to trauma, but potentially helpful for relaxation and sleep.


   * ADHD gang and anyone else struggling with slowness/stillness right now may find moving meditation more helpful, which isnt on here.





**2. Text-only interaction (anonymous &amp; available 24/7)**





* [Disaster Distress Helpline](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline)


   * You text with a trained counselor about how youre feeling and whatever difficulties or concerns youre having. Like a normal text conversation, it takes them a few minutes to reply sometimes, and it doesnt feel as personal as talking to someone on the phone or IRL.


   * They consider mass shootings a type of disaster and so the counselors refer to last week as a disaster which felt a little odd at first, but otherwise it was helpful to me, particularly for talking about survivors guilt, nightmares, and that sort of thing.


   * They noticeably use some pre-generated messages where they fit, but this isnt because the counselor youre chatting with is disingenuous, just that there are a limited number of volunteers, so they save time by having frequently repeated messages handy to copy and paste. If anything, it means a lot of other people have needed to know/hear the same thing, which is reassuring in its own way.


* [988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline](https://988lifeline.org/)


   * While suicide is in the name, this service is for anyone in emotional distress.


   * You text with a trained crisis counselor about how youre feeling. They listen, reassure, and help you figure out what you can do to feel a little bit better in the moment. The goal of the conversation is to get you out of that feeling of acute distress, so felt most helpful to text when I was feeling awful, like after a vivid nightmare.


   * At the start of the chat, they ask you to rank how distressed you are and if youre having thoughts of ending your life. If youre not in imminent danger, you may wait a bit to be connected with a counselor.


   * This one was hit or miss for me. Ive used it twice now, and one person I spoke with was incredibly kind and helpful, like talking to a wise older sibling that really cares. The other felt much less authentic, and I didnt find particularly helpful.


* There are a lot of other text helplines, I just havent tried them. [You can find a list on this page if you scroll down and click ""Text, Phone and Hotline Resources""](https://caps.msu.edu/emergency/index.html)





**3. Zoom interaction**





* [Finding a long term therapist on ThrivingCampus](https://msu.thrivingcampus.com)


   * **The most helpful thing for me has been finding a therapist to work with via ThrivingCampus.** I saw them on Zoom, but some therapists offer IRL appointments as well (says on their profiles).


   * Lets you filter by identity, practice area, insurance, types of issues they work with, and other factors. If you select available for crisis response in the filtering sidebar on the left, youll only get therapists who have specifically signed up to be available in the aftermath of incidents like this.


   * Pros: I was able to find someone to start seeing that week from the same fairly small identity group as me. The sessions are about an hour long (exact length depends on the therapist and your insurance), which allowed a lot more time to get into things vs just skim the surface.


   * Cons: It is normal therapy like if you found them on Google, so while the website to find them is free, the sessions cost money. How much will depend on your insurance. There is a section at the top left to filter by therapists offering limited free sessions, but I did not try that and don't know how it works.


* [Uwill 1-on-1 teletherapy](https://app.uwill.com/)


   * Free 30 min Zoom session with a licensed therapist - just need to sign up with your MSU email.


   * Pros: you get to pick the therapist. The one I spoke with was an MSU alum and very nice.


   * Cons: 30 min goes by quickly. It helps to make a list ahead of time if there are questions or topics you want to make sure to get to.


   * After your first session, you have the option to schedule more free Zoom sessions, or you can do them on the phone, via text, or by email. Personally, Ive found being able to send an email to the therapist I spoke with really helpful just to have someone Im not as worried about judging me to tell how a tough day went and get some support and suggestions. They reply within 24 hours.

"2023-02-07",1675733096,"As a staff employee at MSU, it seems the university has designed it to be irrational to do your job","I am a staff member at MSU. No matter how I look at it, it is not rational to do your job well at this institution. Let me explain why:





Say that person 1 does their job well. Doesnt matter what that is: Reply to an email quickly. Send helpful information to a student. Write a strong report and submit it on time. Take professional development courses and implement what youve learned to improve your office. Join a committee and play a helpful role. Etc.





Heres the first thing that happens next: People see you doing something well (or even doing it at all), and so they go to you for those tasks when they need them again. Other people see that, and they go to you, too. You quickly become very busy, because people increasingly come to you with tasks.





Heres the next thing that happens. Inevitably people ask you to do things outside of your job. In some cases, this is your supervisor, so you often cant say no. But if you do them, eventually people start to view these as your responsibilities. 





Ive been at MSU a few years. Good work has only ever been rewarded with *more work*. All of the people I've seen perform well in their jobs have ended up with responsibilities added on that go far beyond their position. 





Now, consider the alternative, person 2: They dont do some job well. It could be anything: They dont reply to an email. They avoid students or give less than helpful replies. They submit reports late or do them poorly. They are a lackluster committee member. Etc.





Heres the first thing that happens next: People dont ask them to do those things anymore. (They ask person 1 instead, who did them well.) What also happens is that person 2 is not asked to do new things, or if they are and they do them not so well, they arent asked to again in the future. 





Person 1 is overworked, unrewarded, and often the target of blame (because people around them associate them with all the tasks they are now responsible for  and if they arent done, well, who else has ever done them?). Person 2 has free time and lower responsibilities. The bar for decent work is set far lower for them as well.





You might immediately think, ok, but person 2 is eventually going to face consequences  maybe even lose their job, right? In my experience, absolutely not. In fact, the opposite happens to person 2. They have more free time at work, so they use that time to get ahead on some things that are beneficial to them. They use that time to apply to other jobs eventually, too, and sometimes get those jobs or promotions. They fail upwards, and theres a lot of it.





In my opinion, this dynamic is rampant at MSU. You might call it a free rider problem, but it isnt just about individuals, but also the institution. Particularly with staff, good work isnt rewarded, but punished with more work  while not doing your job is rewarded with less work and more free time. 





It is a vicious cycle and reminds me of Catch-22 in its absurdity.","msu",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/10vofvb/as_a_staff_employee_at_msu_it_seems_the/",2023-02-07 01:24:56

"2023-02-15",1676495209,"Black Amerexiter looking for all your advice and help!","Hi Everyone,





Well, I guess I'm finally making a post here. I've been lurking this subreddit for perhaps 2 months now, and I think it's about time I made my own thread for help and advice. To start, I am 34 years old, black, and have been considering leaving the U.S. I first thought about it last year. The Buffalo massacre really got to me -- I almost didn't go to my own graduation because of it. I was so infuriated, as some of the victims could have been my own mother. Now we have what happened at MSU. There is something seriously wrong with our culture (I think it's one of hatred), and sometimes I wonder if it's just me going crazy. Am I consuming too much media? I do not think it is going to get better.





I live in a non-diverse college town on the east coast that houses a PWI. The other day, I visited a local bar and was speaking with an acquaintance (older white guy) that grew up during a time when things were still segregated. I mentioned during our conversation that I didn't grow up in a white neighborhood, and didn't really interact with white students until middle school (my middle school was pretty diverse). He then goes ""Did you get smarter then?"" You know, because the only way black people are intelligent is if they hang around white people (/s). 





That guy's thinking is the same kind of hatred that permeates American society and fuels this country's division. There are people that think just like him that hold positions of power that seriously affect people's lives. What kind of society do you expect to have with people in positions of power that have that level of bias? I digress -- that's not what this thread is about, but I wanted to provide some context for why I am making this thread and considering leaving. Obviously, I want out. The USA isn't the only country in the world. There has to be place where I'm seen as a human first, and not ""black"" or ""black guy"" before anything else. I have traveled outside of the country before, but I have never *lived* in another country. I have been to London, Toronto, Japan, and Aruba by myself.





My field/background is education (most recently edtech) and I have almost a decade of experience in teaching. I've taught in K-8 public education (primarily upper elementary and 6th grade math), and my most recent teaching experience has been teaching (adjuncting) math content courses for education majors/preservice teachers at this university. I have a PhD in education with a specialization in mathematics education from a pretty good university here. I graduated last year.





However, I've been really struggling to find a job and I have student loan debt. I had a job that wasn't the right one for me last year, and I left it in November after working there for 10 months. People will say it's a dumb decision to do so, but I wasn't doing what I was hired to do, more work was getting added onto my plate without a bump in salary, and the company had no long-term plan or goals. They were totally winging it. I was also heavily micromanaged. I've been struggling to find a job since, and getting rejected for jobs I am definitely qualified to do. Other than student loan debt, I don't have any other obligations. I don't have any kids, no wife/not married, and I do not own a home. 





I do not think or know if any of this matters, but most people would describe me as friendly. I like to play the ukulele and guitar, video games, and am very good at cooking. I'm an introvert at my core but also a bit of an ambivert. I love to socialize with others and learn from others' experiences.





Is there anyone that can help in terms of the following:





* Countries that I might want to look into and consider moving to? EU? Asia? Any places that might interest me? I am willing to learn a new language. In fact, that fascinates me.


* Any resources that can help me get started? I'm primarily concerned about employment and work/life balance, retirement, culture, citizenship, etc.?


* Should I pay off my student loan debt here first before moving? I assume this is a good idea but I honestly don't know.

My brother is a junior political science major, and most of his classes were in Berkey.  I'm struggling to find the right words to quantify how I feel in this moment. I am angry, sad, grieving for the students we lost, and hoping the students in the hospital are able to recover. I know one has moved to stable condition, which warms my heart for them. I was not able to be on campus that day, and my thoughts are with my colleagues and each and every student who took action in such a terrifying moment.





I am extremely thankful that my brother wasn't in class that day, but the thought that he could have been taken away from me so soon breaks my heart. I mourn for Brian, Alexandria, and Arielle. I did not know them, but I remember being an undergraduate student burning with motivation to do good in the world, and I weep that they were taken so soon. They had so much more to give to the world.

One of my friends had to lock down in Phillips hall, the other was working the service desk in west shaw.  I was an hour away sobbing because I didnt know what was going on or if theyd be okay. I hopped in my car asap with my mom to wait in okemos for the all clear so I could hug them both.

I dont know why Im saying all of this, I just think I needed to get it out to people who might understand.  Every moment Im not crying or shut down, Im guilty for not grieving for my community.  Every time I am grieving for those lost, I feel guilty because I never even knew them.  When I get those weird intrusive thoughts of me getting hurt in the Union, I feel guilty because I was lucky that I never got hurt.  I feel guilty writing this because Im just complaining, I realize that. I hate this and I dont know how to stop it.  I know nobody can fix anything but I appreciate anyone who took the time to read.

Thai media reports about 90 minutes ago that Tubtim ""Sue"" Howson was placed on a plane bound for the US.  Below is a link to an article in the Thai language, but there are many pictures of her in the airport surrounded by plain clothes Thai police.





[https://www.khaosod.co.th/around-thailand/news\_7525195](https://www.khaosod.co.th/around-thailand/news_7525195)





Original post below:





Fugitive on the loose...





Here is a report of a press conference in which Mrs. Howson was captured, but would not be extradited to the US.





[https://apnews.com/article/thailand-government-united-states-michigan-accidents-07c2eedf6cef5548d922b9394492ca91](https://apnews.com/article/thailand-government-united-states-michigan-accidents-07c2eedf6cef5548d922b9394492ca91)





On January 1, 2023, on her way to work at 5:30 AM, Tubtim ""Sue"" Howson, a Thai American, struck and killed MSU engineering student Benjamin Kable with her car.  Instead of providing aid, she fled the scene.  Using wreckage from the scene of the crime Rochester, Oakland County (Michigan) police were able to locate the car on January 5th.  Mrs Howson had already fled the US to Thailand on January 3rd.





She stayed in her home in Chonburi, Eastern Thailand from January 5th, when she arrived, until February 8th when the pressure from news reports became too much.  Than she fled to the Western Thailand, near the border with Myanmar (Burma) before giving herself up to the Thai police.  She was near the Myanmar border because she was wanting to flee Thailand to escape arrest.





This is where it gets interesting...  The Thai police caught her and gave a big press conference with a high ranking police officer.  They told her side of the story (she claims she thought she hit a deer and was in shock) and the police told the public, **they were not going to arrest her** (Even though the US has requested she be extradited back to the US.  The US and Thailand have an extradition treaty).  The police said she was willing to return to the United States and that **she would be on a plane before Sunday, 19 February.**  They said Ms Howson returning to the US on her own free will would be an example of the high morality of the Thai people.  Nonsense!  Thailand is more concerned about it's image as a tourist destination (with moral people) than in justice in the US.





Here it is evening, Tuesday, 21 February 2023 in Thailand and **Mrs. Howson still has not gotten on a plane**.  She seems to be free in Thailand and responsible for her own timeline as to when she will turn herself in (if ever).  There is still the possibility that she escapes Thailand to a neighboring country (that does not have an extradition treaty).  Thai police is notoriously corrupt.  It would not be difficult to bribe the police to gain her freedom.





This is very disturbing.





The Oakland County Sheriff who has been giving reports on this case is Michael J. Bouchard.  He has given interviews with the press prior to Mrs. Howson being found in Thailand.  **The public needs to have a status update from the police department.**  This whole case seems to be falling apart, but there are no reports in the American or Thai press.  It looks as though Mrs. Howson is getting away.  She will not return on her own unless she is pressured to do so.  **If the public remains quiet, the Thai police will do nothing and Mrs. Howson will get away with killing Benjamin Kable.**

The 2022/23 NFL season is officially  in the books, with the Chiefs beating out the Eagles in the tremendous  back-and-forth of Super Bowl LVII. So now its time to progress to  offseason content, with free agency and a length pre-draft process.





Some  people may have already missed some of that, as we had a full week  between the East-West Shrine and Senior Bowl events. We have three/four  days of practice and a game each to break down, to see which young  prospects have already stood out and helped themselves in terms of  showcasing their talents to NFL scouts.





I  watched every practice period and the games, to recap everything we saw  in Las Vegas and Mobile respectively, and settled on ten players on  each side of the ball, which I wanted to point out as early risers in  this process. Plus, I added a few other names, who I thought helped  themselves, at the end.

# Quarterback  Jake Haener, Fresno State





While  Haener was originally a three-star recruit for Washington, he only  threw 13 total passes for the Huskies, due to presence of eventual  fourth-round pick Jacob Eason, before transferring to Fresno State.  Across three seasons there, he completed 68.2 of his passes for just  over 9000 yards and 67 touchdowns, compared to 17 interceptions. And in a  quarterback class with a lot of uncertainty after the top-four I would  say, I think this young man showed that he should be in the discussion  for the next names up.





I thought  throughout Senior Bowl  especially from day two on  Haener was easily  the most consistent quarterback of the week. His second day may have  been the most impressive, as he was right on point with multiple deep  passes during one-on-ones, showed the ability to work through  progressions in seven-on-sevens and was very accurate throwing on the  move. He continued to stand above the rest on day three, with a  tremendous red-zone session, putting the ball perfectly away from  trailing defenders for his receivers to make a play on vertical routes,  and getting the ball out just as the back-foot hit off play-action and  pinning it to chest of guys crossing the field. One ball in particular  stood out, when he put it high and slightly behind Purdue tight-end  Payne Durham on a wheel route out of a tight stack, away from the  trailing defender, for a touchdown during red-zone drills of day three   although the TE deserves credit as well for holding onto the ball  through a big hit.





Obviously  Haener ended up being named the Senior Bowl MVP for his performance in  the game Saturday, where he went 12-of-19 for 139 yards and a touchdown,  including a 44-yard score to Michael Wilson, making him work back and  high-point the ball on a post route off play-action, to cap the day.  However, for me it was his command of the offense and how well he  acclimated himself with new guys around him, that he didnt have a whole  lot of time to build chemistry with eyes. His eyes didnt drop with  bodies around him in the pocket and once he left that space, you saw  Haener pointing at guys and making them adjust their routes on the fly  on multiple occasions.

# Running back  Tyjae Spears, Tulane





Unless  youre a casual college football fan, who doesnt pay much attention to  the Non-Power Five Conference, you probably at least saw Spears flash  across your screen a couple of times this past season. He just cracked  1000 scrimmage yards in 2021 already, before being the driving force  Tulanes Cinderella 12-2 season last year, when he exploded for over  1800 total yards and 21 TDs, making him the AAC Offensive Player of the  Year.





Spears was the biggest  winners of measurements probably, weighing in at 202 pounds, despite  having the reputation of a change-of-pace/scat back by some who scout  off physical dimensions. However, for people watching the tape, this guy  breaks way more tackles than youd expect, and in a setting that favors  guys with great explosive traits, this kid was able to on a show. When  given a runway, you saw that explosion through the hole and ability to  clear the second level in a hurry. He had one that stood out the first  day and wouldve been off to the races on several occasions on one-cut  schemes the second practice.





More  importantly, he showed the ability to effortlessly make cuts that allow  him to get around the edge when defenders didnt take care of their  contain assignments, and how he used those cat-like quicks in tight  areas way on full display. On day two, he made a crazy 90-degree cut to  the outside once during the inside run portion, where he somehow was  able to keep his balance and it almost looked like a player on Madden,  where the replay would make you think this wouldnt happen in real  life. Later on, he caught a swing route for massive yardage during  seven-on-sevens and had a homerun call, where he wasnt touched, slicing  around blockers and making the safety miss, the first time he touched  the ball during full team period.





Still,  Spears will have to play a major role on passing downs to maximize his  skill-set, and even though it didnt count because the coaches said  triple-breaks werent allowed, he kind of went viral with a clip from  the competition period that kicked off day three. He ran this pivot  route vs. Pitt LB SirBocea Dennis Dennis, where he went on an out  initially, before sticking his outside foot in the ground to pirouette  back inside, whilst ducking underneath the defender basically  his  quicks and ankle flexibility looked unreal there. And important to see  for scouts  he got run over by Jackson State LB Aubrey Miller Jr. once  during pass-pro drills of day two, but on the second one he stood his  ground and was able to get enough of him, to guide him off track. NFL  executives voted him the overall Player of the Week.

# Running back  Jordan Mims, Fresno State





Now  combining the running back position and the school I started with in  Fresno State, theres another former Bulldog who turned some heads in  Las Vegas. Despite sharing the backfield with Ronnie Rivers in 2021,  Mims racked up over 1000 yards and ten touchdowns from scrimmage. Last  season he came just two yards shy of 1500 total and was one score away  from doubling his TDs from the season prior, earning himself first-team  All-Mountain West accolades.





While  his receiving production dipped a little bit this past year, it didnt  take long for Mims to showcase that he can still be a valuable asset in  that area of the game. His suddenness and ability to manipulate  linebackers with his eyes, to create separation as a route-runner, came  up regularly. He looked comfortable when flexed out wide, once running a  great curl route, where he really dropped those hips, attacked back  towards the quarterback and snatched the ball over his head, away from  his frame. And after the catch during full plays, he consistently looked  to make the first man miss. In blitz pick-up day, Mims stepped up and  brought his punch, before guiding linebackers off track. Considering he  had already impressed as a pass-catcher, he stood his ground much better  than I expected. He almost got a little overaggressive in his approach  at times I thought, but I liked his attitude in that regard and he  simply didnt lose many reps.





In  team drills, Mims burst to the corner stood out on multiple occasions.  That included some nice moments pressing a crease and then bouncing  around traffic before getting back downhill. You saw him cut down his  stride length, kind of hide behind blockers and force linebackers to  commit. And the show didnt stop in the actual game, being involved as a  receiver in the flats and creating easy yardage, displaying his burst  through the line and delivering the longest run of the day (30 yards)  early on, where he cut a zone run all the way back and broke the ankles  of a DB on like a cross-over move, to get out to the sideline. Thats  after already having been voted the East RB of the Week.

# Wide receiver  Demario Douglas, Liberty





Just  a two-star recruit in 2019, Douglas increased his production every  single year with the Flames, going for 1100 yards and seven touchdowns  on 84 touches this past season, which earned him first-team  All-Independent accolades. Libertys season saw a disappointing finish,  losing their final four games after an 8-1 start, but their top receiver  excelled throughout the year and nearly had as many yards through the  air as the next four players combined.





The  first line I wrote about Douglas, when I started watching the practice  was: This guy is explosive for sure. When he sticks his foot in the  ground after hesitating off the line, he can leave people behind in the  dust, and in particular he showed that on some out routes, where he got  two or three yards on them on multiple occasions, at the moment he  caught the ball. On the first day, you see him make some dramatic cuts  and separate from defensive backs as he re-accelerated out of those. You  saw DBs starting to just sit back on him from the second day one,  because theyd rather gave up a completion underneath than get burnt  over the top. Yet if they did try to put hands on him, Douglas threw a  little chicken-wing once on a deep out route and created enough of a  window for the ball to arrive.





Douglas  made a great over-the-shoulder grab to the outside on a slot fade route  in one-on-ones of day two, quickly bringing it in and not allowing the  raking hands of the corner to knock it loose. The moment of the period  however was the former Flames standout completely shaking another poor  guy and making him trip over his own feet, as he pushed upfield before  bending it to the post later. He also had a great grab high-pointing a  ball thrown behind him on a deep crosser during team portion, and you  saw Douglas speed show up big-time on a reverse during the team portion  of the first practice, beating everybody to the opposite sideline. With  a potential first-rounder in Boston Colleges Zay Flowers only taking  part in one practice, the receiver group for the West side was lacking  some star power, but Douglas more than just filled that void, and was  voted the WR of the Week for that side.

# Wide receiver  Michael Wilson, Stanford





This  guy was certainly a forgotten name by the general draft media, as a  former four-star recruit, who put up nearly 700 yards and five  touchdowns as a true sophomore. He only played in 14 combined games over  the past three seasons (64-864-5) due to multiple injuries that knocked  him out for the year, but ultimately got to show his skills again  big-time during Senior Bowl week.





There  were reports early in the week that Wilson trains with former Pro Bowl  WR T.J. Houshmandzadeh and it was on displays with his route-running.  Right off the bat, he showed that hes a name to track all week, when he  cooked his former Stanford teammate Kyu Blu Kelly off the line on a  slant route during the first one-on-one session. Wilson continued to  make guys look foolish off the line, with slow-playing the get-off and  his body language, to get corners leaning the wrong way. On several  occasions, he was made the job for the quarterback, as he got a couple  of steps on his man with diamond releases on slant routes. Day three he  also ran a beautiful curl route against USCs Mekhi Blackmon, where he  had like a walk-up approach before threating vertically with that burst  down the sideline and then sticking his foot in the ground to come back  to the QB.





Along with the way he  was able to play with guys off the ball, he also showed the ability to  reduce his size and not have any delay breaking out to the sideline,  after threatening vertically. Further down the field, I really liked how  he would tilt and lean into defenders, before breaking guys off and  shaking them off. And he showed great focus when guys were able to  re-enter the catch window due to imperfect throws, yet Wilson pinned the  ball against his chest right away. He did so once on a post route  versus Iowas Riley Moss, where the had to slow down for the throw. When  the ball was lofted over his head a couple of times, Wilson showed that  he does have that extra gear when the ball is in the air, to run  underneath it. He once got past Marylands Jakorian Bennett on an  awesome stutter-go, where he really turned his body and snapped his head  around for a split-second, before taking off, and then couldnt quite  hold onto the ball in the end-zone, as he was just able to get his  fingertips on it. And then of course he ended the week with an  exclamation mark, when he caught a 44-yard touchdown late in the game on  Saturday, on an intentionally underthrown post route off play-action,  where Jake Haener allowed him to work back and high-point the ball.

# Tight-end  Daniel Barker, Michigan State





These  all-star events are always a great opportunity for players, who were  underutilized in college, to prove they can take on a more extensive  role at the next level, and thats true for tight-end in particular.  Barkers production over the last four years (three with Illinois and  one with the MSU) was very consistent, but never really up to where you  want to see it, catching between 18 and 21 passes for 200 to 300 yards  in each of them.





Day one, this guy  kind of looked different to the rest of the TE group, as he had a few  very impressive routes versus the safeties in one-on-ones. His ability  to attack their blind spots of those guys, stay disciplined with not  tilting in his stem, and get a step on them with his burst out of the  break was on display on corner and out routes in particularly early on.  Yet, he continued to excel on day two, where I thought he manipulated  guys with his eyes, some hesitation and body language, before sticking  his foot in the ground and getting away from them. Just watching the  release drills, I thought Barker looked more like a receiver at times  against true square press, throwing out a split release and blowing by  DBs untouched basically.





During  team drills, he showcased the speed to quickly clear the second level on  seam/streak routes and then got his head around right away, where those  Shrine quarterbacks passed on multiple opportunities to feed him the  ball, I thought. When tangled up with DBs further down the field, Barker  packed a pretty strong rip, to fight through the reach of defenders  trying to grab him. And then off that ability to push vertically, he  features a quick turn to the outside on hitches and hooks, to make the  safety flying down on him miss. You typically saw him pluck the ball out  of the air and rip it into his frame, especially when going over the  middle. Finally, while Barker probably isnt a major asset in pass-pro,  he did enough versus the linebackers to guide them off track usually  during those drills.

# Tight-end  Luke Musgrave, Oregon State





Now,  on nearly the complete opposite side of the country, we watched a much  more highly-touted college tight-end more than live up to his status in  Mobile. Musgrave did crack the 300-yard mark in 2021, although he only  he reached the end-zone once on 22 grabs. His redshirt junior campaign  was cut short one-and-a-half weeks in, but he was able to haul in 11  passes for 169 and a TD up to that point. And the scouts liked enough  what they saw, to make him confident to declare for the draft.





When  you say in an interview day one that you felt you were like 60% right  now, in your first time on the field since September and you look the  way you did, youre going to make some headlines. We saw Musgrave glide  across the field more like a big wide receiver and he was used further  down the field quite a bit. When he was allowed to run down the post and  take linebackers vertical, he was leaving them behind in the dust  typically. On several occasions, he would lean into defenders with  outside leverage, then step into their space and head-fake towards their  leverage, in order to create separation bending it to the post. Day  three on early competition one-on-ones, Musgrave did so going up against  LSUs Jay Ward on a seam/skinny post route, where he hit an effective  double-hand swipe to work around the press attempt and then got a couple  of steps on the DB.





However, hed  also present himself underneath on some hook and stick routes, where he  used his frame to protect the ball and wrapped it up tightly in  traffic. Musgrave also ran some beautiful corner routes throughout the  week, where he adjusted the angle of the break accordingly, depending on  the coverage and once caught one of the safeties badly, trying to  undercut the out-break. The former Beaver made some impressive-looking  catches through the first two days, really swallowing the ball with  those large paws  extending, plucking and also quickly pulling the ball  into his frame. And while he may not have stood out in that fashion as a  run-blocker, the balance and effort were a plus to note, and I think he  made an impression on some people, when he talked about how he started  to find joy in that area of the game, as the OSU coaches got him to buy  into it. Musgrave also cracked 20 mph on the GPS-tracker, making him the  16th-fastest player at the entire event despite being 255 pounds  the  next-closest guy who was faster, weighed 24 pounds less.

# Offensive tackle  Jaelyn Duncan, Maryland





I  had a tough time settling on a tackle here, because the great  competition those guys at East-West Shrine week faced, made it tough for  guys to really put some quality reps on tape, and looking at the Senior  Bowl, Ohio States Dawand Jones looked awesome day one, but decided to  shut it down after that. I did mention a couple of other names I was  thinking about here, but ultimately the Maryland tackle was my choice. A  former four-star recruit, Duncan initially took a redshirt before  taking over the starting gig on the blindside year two and starting all  but three of his final 42 games.





Athleticism  was never really a question for me evaluating Duncan, but just watching  him go up against the best competition in the country, he reminded me  of the type of movement skills he brings to the table. Routinely, he  would show off the foot quickness to cut off the angle for edge rushers  and force them on a wider loop, as he guided them past the quarterback.  His smooth lateral movement and loose hips when he did have to turn with  guys were equally impressive on the left and right  where he never  lined up at Maryland.





With that  being said, Duncans ability to deal with power as a pass-protector on  top of it, was what really convinced me. He consistently kept his elbows  in tight and was able anchor against bull-rush attempts. He had some  great moment against Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey in particular, once  stoning in him during full team plays on day two, which popped off the  screen. And then on day three, he was able to handle Foskeys long-arm  on back-to-back reps during one-on-ones, where he probably forced the  edge rusher to go for it again a second time by the way he Duncan was  able to square that guy up. For a guy whose calling card was that  athletic skill-set in protection, I thought the former Terp did a nice  job of rolling his hips through contact and driving his feet, in order  to create movement in the run game on top of that.

# Interior O-line  Atonio Mafi, UCLA





I  had a really tough time deciding on which interior O-lineman I wanted  to talk about here, because there were three names that stood above the  rest during East-West Shrine week  Penn States Juice Scruggs, N.C.  States Chandler Zavala and the guy I settled on in Mafi. He actually  started his career on the defensive line with the Bruins, before  transitioning back to offense and finally starting all 13 games at left  guard last season, earning second-team All-Pac-12 accolades by league  coaches.





We had a lot of powerful  interior D-linemen in Vegas, who tried to test Mafi during one-on-ones,  and they all failed basically. Throughout the week, the former UCLA  guard kept his hands in tight and was able to stymie those guys from a  strong group on the other side, trying to go through him. When opposing  rushers tried to lift him up on rip move and get underneath him, Mafi  rode those guys up the field, away from the quarterback. Day three he  completely stone-walled Boise States big D-tackle Scott Matlock on a  bull-rush attempt, along with not allowing Penn States P.J. Mustipher  to get to the outside edge on him, trying to swipe away the hands. Even  when it looked momentarily like he got his weighted shifted the wrong  way against somebody else on a hesitation move to the outside, he was  able to ride that guy past the QB.





I  dont think he truly lost a single rep during one-on-ones either of the  first two days and maybe one on day three. Yet, on top of his  individual efforts, he also proved his value as a run-blocker during  team drills. Mafi provided a solid bump on the angular block of combos,  to open up lanes right up the gut. The second day on the first snap of  inside run installs, he did a great job of caving in P.J. Mustipher  slanting across his face as a three-technique, and two plays later he  and the left tackle drove that guy right into the lap of the linebacker  behind it, allowing Minnesota running back Mohamed Ibrahim to cut behind  them for an untouched TD. For a guy who weighed in at just under 340  pounds, I thought Mafis ability to beat linebackers to the spot when  climbing up and his burst as a puller really popped as well. For that,  he was named the West IOL of the Week.

# Interior O-line  John Michael Schmitz, Minnesota





Its  not like Schmitz really needed to prove a whole during Senior Bowl, as  he was already regarded as one of the top interior offensive linemen in  this class coming in. However, with that showcase, he fortified himself  as OC1 and a first-rounder most likely. Schmitz would have most likely  been a top-100 pick last year already, with 19 starter at the pivot and  being a second-team All-Big Ten performer. Yet, he improved to  first-team all-conference and played as well as any center in the  country this past season.





Everything  this guy does is solid. His ability to frame rushers and control reps  with vice grip hands made him nearly impossible to get by during  one-on-one pass-protection drills. He completely shut down Alabamas  D.J. Dale and Oklahomas Will Redmond on a couple of occasions, trying  to power through him in pass-pro, on day two, where they couldnt find  any counter on the second of back-to-back tries against him. The only  rep I can remember him losing theoretically was probably once against  South Carolinas Zacch Pickens on day three, who sold out for just  getting upfield to one side and made the dummy quarterback move, but he  didnt actually get a hand on that trainer. And when the defense was  running some two-on-two games to close that session, Schmitz perfectly  timed up his upward strike to shut down the Alabama IDL Byron Young once  looping around towards the center.





During  team drills, Schmitzs ability to execute more diverse assignments than  that zone-heavy rushing attack he was part of Minnesota, was on  display. He did utilize his upper-body strength to torque shade-nose  tackles and allow the back to press the front-side on numerous occasions  on outside zone, but he also created good vertical movement on combos  and climbed off those under good control. The most fun for me were a  couple of highly impressive moments full 11-on-11 plays, where he set  the key block out in front of Tulanes explosive RB Tyjae Spears and  Okahomas Eric Gray respectively, who both ripped off chunk plays each,  and Schmitz sent one of the biggest standouts across those first two  days in Sacramento State LB Marte Mapu flying a couple of yards on one  of them.

# Edge defender  Will McDonald IV, Iowa State





I  really couldnt settle on an edge defender from East-West Shrine week. I  mentioned a couple of those names at the end and there were a few  others I considered. Yet, at the Senior Bowl, I would say that was more  of an underwhelming group, looking at names like Auburns Derick Hall,  Notre Dames Isaiah Foskey and Armys Andre Carter. So I thought it was  appropriate to bring up a name, which many considered part of that tier,  but probably elevated his stock above those guys. McDonald was a very  productive player for the Cyclones these last three years, combining for  33.5 tackles for loss, 27 sacks, eight forced fumbles and seven passes  batted down at the line.





The  question coming into the week was McDonalds size, with more of a lanky  build at 63 ½ and 241 pounds. Yet, I didnt feel like he was lacking  that strength in run defense, being first to attack with his hands and  anchoring against angular blocks routinely. I mean he stood his ground  against Tennessees Darnell Wright a couple of times, who weighed in at  342 pounds  basically exactly 100 more than McDonald. So while some of  his tape would suggest he may have issues setting a physical edge, we  now have evidence that as a true base D-end/outside linebacker, he can  take care at the point of attack. Now, with that being said, what he did  as a pass-rusher obviously was what turned the heads of scouts.





Watching  him run the hoop drill, you saw that ankle mobility and bend to circle  around, which directly translates to rushing the passer. He had a couple  of reps during the week, where he cleanly defeated the hands of the  tackle with a double-hand swipe or chop-rip and even if that guy was  able to still get a hand on him, he would stay on that arc, once even  doing so on all fours basically. Off that, he then put a wicked spin  move on Tennessees right tackle on the second of back-to-back reps  one-on-one, after threating the corner and then stepping into the  blockers space, in order to make him commit on the latter. And that  ability to take the inside door opening up as guys had to overset to the  outside came into play on day three as well, when he beat Floridas on a  rapid up-and-under. Later during red-zone team period, you saw  McDonalds closing burst when Shepherd QB Tyson Bagent left the pocket  the other way and the D-end wouldve run him down like a lion hunting an  antelope, if not for pulling up late, to avoid pushing him in the back.

# Interior D-line  Dante Stills, West Virginia





This  has been one of my guys for like three years. I first started taking  note of Stills, when I was watching his brother Darius play alongside  him on the WVU defensive line  who I liked quite a bit as well  and  have been waiting on Dante to go pro since then. Across these past four  seasons, he has racked up 47.5 tackles for loss, 21.5 sacks and three  forced fumbles, going from second-team All-Big 12 in the first two to  first-team all-conference the latter two years.





After  lining up at 4i- and 5-technique a lot for the Mountaineers due to his  combination of size and length, Stills almost exclusively played  three-technique throughout East-West Shrine week and let me tell  this  guy was unblockable! Early on day one he had a pass-rush rep, where he  cleanly beat the Oregon guard across his face with a swim move, where it  wasnt even a contest. His ability to win up the gap with a quick  club-rip combo, stay on track through contact as he was cornering his  rushes and then win cross-face when guys started oversetting him, was  crazy to watch. Thats along with having the power at nearly 290 pounds  to ride blockers into the depth of the pocket, if they decide to give  him ground.





Yet, Stills mightve  been even more impressive in the run game. Routinely he would win his  gap and own his space, while locking out with one arm, to shut down  one-on-ones prematurely. There was a sequence day two, where he just  threw the Grand Valley guard Quinton Barrow, trying to reach-block him,  to the turf, as he caught the blocker pulling the back-leg through,  trying to bring his base around. And then on the re-do, he back-doored  that guy, which Im not sure is how theyre supposed to drill it, but  the cat-like quicks where impressive nevertheless. Stills showed his  disruptive skills in team run drills as well, crashing through the  shoulder of zone blockers and flashing from the backside, along with  arm-over and back-dooring a couple of times to force quick cutbacks as  well. He didnt really allow combos to form, knocking away the help-hand  of the man trying to peel off and not wasting time with the guy trying  to bring his hips around. I feel pretty certain that Stills led  everybody in tackles for loss each of the first two days. Teammates  recognized him as the IDL of the Week on the East side. In the actual  game, he swum over and created a TFL on his first series, before getting  another one on the last defensive play for the East.

# Interior D-line  Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin





Unlike  the edge group down in Mobile, which lacked names that could really set  themselves apart, other than Iowa States Will McDonald, I thought  there were multiple guys on the interior, who deserve to be mentioned.  Nevertheless, none of those did impress quite like Wisconsins Keeanu  Benton. Last year he inexplicably dropped from second- to third-team  All-Big Ten, despite reaching career-highs in tackles (36), TFLs (10)  and sacks (4.5), along with two more passes batted down.





Since  I hadnt really studied Bentons tape since the offseason, where I  thought based on 2021, he was a solid, worker-bee type shade nose  tackle, I was shocked to see this guy flash as much as he did throughout  Senior Bowl week. Day one, he showed off his power and ability to pull  linemen off himself right away during pass-rush drills. Thats along  with guys oversetting to the outside and Benton blowing through the  interior in a hurry with the tight arm-over to clear the blockers  reach. Day two he mightve been even more impressive. He killed the Troy  center Jake Andrews on consecutive reps, beating him instantly on a  club-swim combo and then getting grabbed on the latter, where it looked  like he had the O-linemans shoulders turned and wouldve been able to  get across his face, if not for the tug. When setting up cross-face and  club-rip moves generally, you saw Benton torque his upper body more than  sufficiently, and when he ripped through, it looked more like he was  starting a cold chainsaw, with the way he yanked that arm up.





In  run defense, Benton routinely brought the fight, going from stacking at  full extension, to swatting away the hands, placing himself in the gap  and pulling guys off himself. He did so during one-on-ones as well as  full-team portions of practice. His wrestling background was on display,  winning with quickness, leverage and violent hands. Bentons official  stat log in the actual game will only read one tackle, but he did have a  couple of QB hits, once beating TCUs Steve Avila trying to slide in  front of him and putting that guys teammate Max Duggan on his backside.  Thats along with how disruptive he was all week in team drills and his  effort chasing away from the play.

# Linebacker  Jeremy Banks, Tennessee





A name I was vaguely familiar with, but hadnt studied yet is this  fifth-year senior from Tennessee. Banks wouldve probably been higher on  my watch list based on his 2021 stats, when he recorded 128 total  tackles, 11.5 of those for loss, 5.5 sacks, an interception and four  PBUs. However, this past season the majority of those numbers were more  than cut in half and based on consensus boards, hes on the fringe of  even being drafted  if he has a solid combine, he may be moving closer  to an early day three prospect.





And  what really made me perk up was watching this young man in coverage.  During one-on-ones with the running backs, Banks displayed some  impressive burst when driving on option routes, where they could break  either way. He would regularly just squat on guys and still affect the  catch point once he exploded forward as they made their cut. Banks was  one of like two guys that could actually pick up and run with Fresno  State back Jordan Mims in team drills as well. He did a nice job  identifying dig routes and deep crossers coming in behind him during  seven-on-sevens and full team drills. Plus, you saw him redirect in a  hurry after floating one way initially and then having to race down on  the back catching a checkdown. He had a very impressive snap in coverage  day two against a tight-end I already highlighted in Michigan States  Daniel Barker, turning with him down the seam and getting a paw between  that guys hands, to bat the ball up for the safety behind him to pluck  for the interception.





In team run  drills, I thought Banks showed great lateral agility to trail runners  from the backside and flatten behind blockers when he saw an opening, as  well as pair quick hands and jumping sideways to get to the other side  of linemen looking to pin him away from the action. And on the  play-side, he was very quick to fill before somebody could combo off to  him. When did have to deal with guys climbing up, Banks pulling those  off himself, to get hands on the ball-carrier was something that  happened on multiple occasions. And a couple of times he blew through  the outside shoulder of the fullback before that guy could even get to  the line of scrimmage, to create disruption in the backfield. Banks also  had a few nice moments in the game, side-stepping blockers and once  putting a huge hit on UCLA back Kaz Allen in the hole. During protection  drills, you saw the former Vol LB charge full-force into running backs  in blitz pick-up a few times, plus then he was slippery once he used his  hands, to slither around them.

# Linebacker  Marte Mapu, Sacramento State





While  I was familiar with Banks as a prospect, I had no idea who this other  linebacker from Sacramento State was. Yet, with the way he was wrecking  plays during Senior Bowl practices, he made me take note. Mapu was a  versatile piece for the Hornet defense, splitting time between safety,  outside linebacker and nickelback. In 2022, he was named the Big Sky  Defensive Player of the Year, for putting up 76 tackles, 6.5 of those  for loss, two passes intercepted and six more broken up.





After  showing out at NFLPA Bowl week, Mapu got the call up from Jim Nagy and  my god, he made most of that opportunity. I thought he looked pretty  impressive from the first moment he stepped onto the field. You saw him  rapidly fill on the front-side of run plays and even from the backside,  you saw the short-area burst to shoot through a crease and run things  down, where nobody was able to get in front of him in time. Mapu had a  couple of big-time run stuffs during the inside run portion of day two,  once blowing through the shoulder of the guard on a zone run and meeting  the back for a TFL, and then another time on an iso-run, absolutely  blasting the fullback before that guy could even reach the line of  scrimmage, allowing the rest of the defense converge on the ball.





On  top of that, Mapu also made a couple of impressive plays in coverage as  part of team-drills, once on play-action, where he didnt fall for it  and drifted underneath a dig route, getting a hand on the ball intended  to be lofted over his head, to break it up, and later raking the ball  out of the tight-ends hands on a stick route. Thats along with running  down Houston standout WR striding out after a solid play, where he was  still fired up and punched the ball out, with nobody else in the screen   not that it actually counted, but it shows his level of effort. And he  had a couple of nice wins pass-pro drills, once side-stepping Oklahoma  RB Eric Gray, combined with the arm-over, to get around him cleanly.  Mapu was clocked over 19 MPH multiple times during the week and his  speed will be a major buy-in for NFL teams, considering his tremendous  special teams background. Unfortunately he wasnt able to perform in the  game on Saturday, but I promise you, basically all scouts will have  added his name to their watch list and there will probably be a few more  now heading to the Sac State pro day, since he didnt receive a combine  invite.

# Cornerback  Lance Boykin, Coastal Carolina





A  position group with several noteworthy names between the East-West  Shrine and Senior Bowl was cornerback. I couldnt help myself but talk  about three games here, with a couple of them from Vegas, and Boykin is  kicking things off. Once just a two-star recruit, this guy began his  career at Old Dominion, before making a name for himself with the  Chanticleers, where he recorded five interceptions, 12 PBUs and two  sacks across his two seasons there.

The professor was not willing to push the midterm back to next week or offer to put the questions online for students to take. Anyone who didnt show up received a 0. Am I crazy for thinking this is insane?? One of the students my sister has for group work told her that her best friend is in the hospital on her death bed from being shot last week, and she left her side to go take an exam. 





I understand there is a credit / no credit option. Does anyone else feel this isnt enough? My sister is a junior and has As in her classes, so she really doesnt want to do credit / no credit. I feel at a minimum students shouldve had an extra week to heal. Professors had a week to make PowerPoints and record lectures, so why wasnt posting material online required by the university until at least after spring break? 





My sister is traumatized. She was across the street from the union when shots rang out and ran home to her off campus house to take cover. She knew the girl Alex who passed away. One week is NOT enough time to heal! Many people cant return back to a place of trauma without it impacting their mental health more, especially one week later! Im so disappointed in MSU and any faculty that are pushing for business as usual. Nothing about this is normal!!! 





This post isnt to downplay the actions the university has taken. Individuals coming together to support each other (like Spartan Sunday) is amazing. But that wasnt the university who came up with the idea. The only solutions offered so far were more police on campus and credit/no credit. I just feel like this isnt enough, and want to know if others feel the same, especially family members of survivors. I wasnt on campus and wont pretend to know what that trauma was like, but I can see my sister is not the same person she was before this happened. I dont think its right or okay to downplay what happened and make students go back to classes and take a MIDTERM eight days after fearing for their lives.

#32 Teams 32 Days 2022-23 NFL Season





**Team: New England Patriots**  


Record: 8-9, Third in AFC East  


Playoffs: No, eliminated Week 18





Greetings one and all, and welcome to 32 Teams in 32 Days: 2022 Season Review for the New England Patriots. This year was a wild one with crazy coaching, bizarre endings, and plot twists you would not believe. This year's Star Wars comparison is The Last Jedi: A plotline with no connections to the previous season, a record going nowhere, and hopefully for the Patriots, character drama ignored next season. Also for the Patriots, the only comparison to Rise of Skywalker I want to make next year is ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". Everything in that movie sucked.





Back on track; My name is Bluethingamajig, and I am back again leading the charge for 32/32 Patriots for the second straight year, and fifth year overall. This year, I am joined by u/ecupatsfan12 and u/SpaceGhost1992. Thank you greatly for your contributions and assistance to this project. And as always, I would like to thank 10hmacarena for the opportunity to write.





This Patriots season was a mix of ups and downs. Compared to last year, there was a lack of extremes. Last year saw wins with 50-burgers but also losses without ever forcing a punt. This year did not have the blowout wins, but also the Patriots did not shit the bed against Buffalo. Arguably. So long as we exclude the kickoff returns.





Without any further ado, let us begin. This document sprawled out to 15,000 words. I hope you enjoy it.

#An Abridged Story





Patriots fans began the year with a mix of optimism and pessimism. Last year, I predicted 9+ wins, noting ""it will be a challenge for the Patriots to make it back to 10 wins and beyond"". Although I believed in the talent of the players and coaching of BB, it was abundantly clear that the offense would likely be worse having lost the last of offensive coaches. In a far too brief summary, the offense changed coaches but not players while the defense changed players but not coaches. 





The defense made drastic changes in classic Belichick style. Fans, pundits, and Personnel Director Groh all noted the lack of speed in linebackers and thin secondary. So Bill picked up a handful of quicker linebacker/box safety types that never quite fit in with their original teams, and drafted a pair of CBs. Ultimately, the Patriots began the regular season with massive question marks on the offense and an exciting, rejuvenated defense. 





This resulted in an uncomfortable season. In the beginning, the offense lacked precision and consistency. The defense, while performing well, could not single-handedly win every game. The Patriots stumbled to a 1-2 start and Mac got injured. After a third loss, things would get better for the middle. Enter Bailey Zappe. He zapped all over the Browns and Lions. Mac returned and after a loss to the Bears, the Patriots won three more in a row. At 6-4, this was the most optimistic Patriots fans would be.





Still, the limits of the team were apparent. We were in the same conversation as teams like the Broncos, Jets, and Steelers: Strong defense and weak offense. The Patriots went 2-4 down the stretch. Three close losses featured the Patriots shooting themselves in the foot. 





Going into Week 18 at 8-8, the Patriots had to win in Buffalo to make the playoffs. Technically, the Pats could lose so long as the Browns and Jets both won. However, I want you to slap yourself thrice if you thought for a single second to rely on both the Browns and Jets to win a game. The Bills had the power of friendship, scriptwriters, and the better team on their side. The Browns and Jets both lost their games, because of course they did, and the Patriots missed the playoffs.

#Three Quick Questions





**Did the Patriots play like an 8-9 team?**





The 8-9 record accurately represents how good the team was. The ""true"" performance of the Patriots team was about 8.5 wins. The Patriots went 5-4 in one-score games and had a slightly positive point differential. Record in one-score games is fundamentally a measure of a team's luck and trends to .500, and most importantly does not have any *predictive* ability for the next year. A team with a good or bad one-score game record is by far the easiest team to pick for regression (i.e. Vikings, Broncos). The 5-4 one-score game record suggests the Pats were .5 games lucky and combines with the slightly positive points differential suggesting the Pats should be 9-8. The Patriots earned their record as is.





**What the hell happened with the coaches?**





All the coaches left for other teams. I'll borrow this quote from The Athletic:  


&gt;Over a span of 14 months starting at the conclusion of the 2020 season, Belichick lost his offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, running backs coach, wide receivers coach and offensive line coach, as well as trusted assistant Ernie Adams...including departures of Nick Caserio and Dave Ziegler, Belichick lost more than 150 years of experience working with him





This quote excludes the coaches that went with Flores to Miami a few years earlier. There is a profound dearth of coaching talent remaining on the offensive side, and even the defensive side felt bare. Recall that Steve Belichick as defensive play caller is not nepotism, he is the most experienced defensive coach on the team.





The offense coaching is Nick Caley and Troy Brown. I like Troy as a person and player, but he has yet to show any meaningful coaching chops. And Nick Caley, despite receiving multiple OC interviews, was deemed not ready by BB. Most importantly, Belichicks first pick for OC (Bill OBrien) was still under contract in Alabama. Essentially, this year was BB knowing the coaching roles were stopgaps yet hoping it might turn out okay. 





So why Patricia? Well, he was available.





**Launch Matt Patricia into the sun**





Not a question. Nevertheless, Belichick clearly was not willing to hire outside the organization before grabbing Bill OBrien for 2023. As a result, there was Caley, Patricia, or Judge to be offensive play caller. Neither Caley nor Judge rose to the occasion. Knowing that Patricia would not last beyond the season, the offense would have a clean slate to bring in a proper OC this offseason. Patricia was set up for failure, even if he did himself no favors. 





Let's not pretend Patricia was the sole fault with the offense. Matt Patricia isn't the one who committed 104 penalties. Matt Patricia isn't the one who gave up on routes. The Patriots offense was not the worst, nor second worst, nor even bottom ten in many statistical categories. Strictly as a play caller, he was okay. It's trendy to blame Patricia. I understand that it is a time-honored tradition and responsibility for fans to overreact. But please try not to confuse r/nfl shitposting with reality.

#Cheers and Jeers





Some quick callouts for those who deserve your attention going forwards, for good or ill.





**Three cheers for...**  


*Marcus, Jack, and Jonathan Jones, Ja'Whaun Bentley, Rhamondre Stevenson, and Michael Onwenu.*





These guys are, in my opinion, the best performers on the team. The Jones CBs quickly built themselves as a new elite corps of defenders, and Marcus Jones showed up in offense and special teams as well. Former 5th round pick Ja'Whaun Bentley is playing himself into a shiny third contract. He has a leadership attitude and puts in the work. Last year, he improved to pretty good LB, and this year improved again to very good LB. At one point, he was top-10 on PFFs LB rankings.





You might recall Rhamondre for two bad plays in the back half of the year. That discredits how he was carrying the offense all year long. The way he can fight through tackles, sneak through gaps, and block linebackers when on protection duty makes him one of the best RBs in the league. And finally, Michael Onwenu is an elite OL at multiple positions.





**Three jeers for...**  


*Isaiah Wynn, Cameron Achord, Jonnu Smith, and Matt Patricia.*





Wynn is a career left tackle and is good when healthy. This year, he chose not to attend voluntary offseason workouts so he got shunted to right tackle based on availability, where he was bad. And then got injured. Again. In his 4-year career, he has missed 24 games to injury. Achord is the Patriots Special Teams coordinator. The Patriots had the 32nd ranked special teams by DVOA this year. Sure, Bailey was injured, but giving up two kickoff TDs in a win-and-in game against the Bills is inexcusable on part of players and coaches. I pray that Joe Judge will reclaim the coordinator role for 2023. Jonnu has made zero impact in games over two years; hopefully BOB will finally get him involved.





And of course, Matt Patricia. Yes, I defended Patricia above, but I do not actually think he was a good offensive coach. He is a bad OC and was a terrible HC for the Lions. Just because there are mitigating factors or that some other teams had it worse does not justify how bad the Patriots offense was.

#Team Highlights and Lowlights  





The NFL is an entertainment product. Here are the highlights we, the writers, loved watching, as well as the lowlights we would prefer not to see ever again.





##Highlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: In a week 11 offensive performance that impressed nobody, the Patriots and Jets slugged it out to a 3-3 draw with 26 seconds left. [The Jets punted](https://www.clippituser.tv/c/qnremr). 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Beating the Browns and Lions, and being competitive with the Vikings and Bills. 





**Spaceghost1992**: Lions game. With a less than stellar start to the season. It was good seeing a goose-egg on the opposing teams scoreboard. Sweeping the Jets is a close second.





##Lowlights  





**Bluethingamajig**: The Cincinnati game. This game perfectly represented the 2022 Patriots season: A bad start against good teams, a strong middle powered by good defense, and when on the cusp of victory, fumbling it all away. In an alternate universe, the Patriots were on to Cincinnati and won. 





**Ecupatsfan12**: Jakobi Meyers lateral and the whole Matt Patricia/Joe Judge debacle.





**Spaceghost1992**: Week 12, Vikings, Hunter Henry call in the middle of the third quarter. One bad play call doesn't decide the outcome, but this match felt winnable. 





Mac Jones showed some flashes of brilliance after a rough start to the season and the defense played well. Sure, the Vikings received a lot of criticism throughout the year--the validity of which isnt for me to say--but they were still one of the top teams in the league. A win here on the road would have been a strong morale boost and possibly what we needed to squeak into a wildcard appearance.

#2022 Roster Changes (Draft and Free Agency)  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*





##2022 NFL Draft Recap





**Round 1 Pick 29- Cole Strange- Guard- UT Chattanooga-** This pick shocked me and the football world out of our collective minds. I had Cole going to Tampa Bay in the top of the third round. It wouldnt have surprised me if we took him at the end of the 2nd round but in fact we drafted him at the end of the first. Cole went through the typical rookie growing pains in the NFL with some very high highs and some low lows. He earned a PFF grade of 55 in his first year in New England- **Grade B+**





**Round 2 Pick 18- Tyquan Thornton-WR-Baylor-**  TQ was mocked to us in the fourth round and I agreed with the pick and projection so I was less hurt that he went to us mid second round. Tyquan had a similar grade to Cole but it comes with a caveat of our offensive woes and him missing half the season with a broken collarbone. Tyquan flashed outstanding speed and I feel very confident in his ability to produce with the ball in his hands. With refinement in his routes and hands- I look for Tyquan to double his stats and produce a solid 2023 season. **Grade- B**.





**Round 3- pick 21- Marcus Jones- Corner- Houston-** My personal favorite pick- I saw him as a potential slot corner and was instantly hooked on him with the ball in his hands. He was a dynamic player with the ball in his hands and I felt that he could play outside corner, inside corner or either safety. He caused me to feel a way inside I havent felt since watching Deebo Samuel tape. Needless to say I was ecstatic we picked him. He did not disappoint- making his impact felt on all 3 sides of the ball. He tallied two picks on the year with 34 solo tackles- ran a punt back for a walk off win at the Jets- overshadowed by the career altering answer of No by Zach Wilson- and even caught a TD against the Bills. I could go on but you get the point here. **Grade A+**





**Round 4 Pick 16-  Jack Jones- Corner- ASU** A physical man corner-who was slated to fill JC Jackson's role. Jack burst onto the scene intercepting a wayward pass from Mr Ayuascha himself for a TD against the Pack.  Jack got another pick on the year and tallied 25 solo tackles. However- he came to us with character concerns from college and spent the last few weeks of the year suspended with his play time fluctuating to sparse snaps against Arizona. The skill set is apparent here- but Mr Jones attitude must improve moving forward- **Grade C**





**Round 4 Pick 22- RB Pierre Strong SDSU** I was pleasantly surprised that we picked Pierre- I had him going to San Francisco where I thought he would feast.  Pierre primarily played on special teams but got ten carries for 100 yards and a touchdown. Most running backs besides Rhamondre dont typically play their first year here- so I will hold off on a grade until next year.





**Round 4 Pick 32- Bailey Zappe QB-WKU-** After obliterating Joe Burrows passing records in a stellar 2021 campaign for the Hilltoppers Bailey was my top choice to be Macs backup this year. Bailey played up to snuff- throwing for 781 yards with 5 TD against 3 picks. I won't rehash the biopic in roster updates- but I am very happy with Bailey and expect him to have a long and fruitful career with the best job in America- back up QB. **Grade A-**





**Round 6 Pick 4- Kevin Harris RB- USC** As previously mentioned, Mr Harris primarily redshirted with his draft classmate Pierre Strong. Kevin rushed for 52 yards on eighteen touches with a singular touch down.  As previously mentioned- Mr Harris needs to work on his speed and his hands out of the backfield and he figures to be the spell for Rhamondres power in 2023- but his draft grade remains incomplete





**Round 6 Sam Roberts DT- NW Missouri State**  A D2 All American-we figured this was Bills small school guy on the defensive line. Roberts made the team which is a huge accomplishment for a rookie but received minimal playing time. As previously mentioned- he looks to receive a MUCH bigger role in 2023 moving forward- Grade incomplete








The Patriots selected Chasen Hines and Andrew Stuebner with their last two picks in the sixth and seventh round respectively. Both will be interior depth pieces this year- I see Stuebner playing a much more prominent role than Hines. LaBryan Ray, Brendan Schooler, and DeMarcus Mitchell were UDFAs that were on the active roster for periods of this past year and look to be on the roster for next year moving forward.

#2022 Free Agent Review  





##Notable Additions





**Mack Wilson (ILB)**  Mr Wilson came to us via trade from the franchise in Cleveland. Mr Wilson shared ILB duties with Juwuan Bentley tallying 36 combined tackles on the year. Bentley is the better player against the run and Wilson against the pass. However- we are migrating to a largely positionless defense with myriad hybrid players and I expect Wilson to duplicate last year's results.





**Jabrill Peppers** Mr Peppers signed with us after missing the majority of 2021 with injuries. Peppers was a fantastic option at safety for us and tallied sixty combined tackles. Jabrill has a nose for the football and is in large part our rover. I see Jabrill being resigned for 2 more seasons and tallying 65 tackles with 2 picks in 2023.





**Ty Montgomery**  Ty came to us to be a special teams wizard- he looked to have the passing back role locked down prior to injury. Because he is up in age and a very inexpensive cut I dont see Montgomery coming back next year.





**Devante Parker** Mr Parker came to us via a trade from the Dolphins and immediately blossomed as our deep threat. I look for another year in NE to pay off tremendously and Parker to tally 47 receptions for 732 yards and 5 TDs.








##Departures





**Chase Winovich-** Mr Winovich played for a couple of disappointing seasons in New England- Chase had a good ability to rush the passer but struggled immensely to learn the variations of his role (the Judon Role) which is the hardest position on the team. He wound up being swapped to the Browns for Mr Wilson.





**JC Jackson**  Mr Jackson departed New England after several years of top tier CB play for a big pay day with the LA Chargers. He suffered a season ending injury and we hope he recovers to the fullest extent that he can- but he struggled a lot with the scheme. Corner in New England is played differently than any other franchise- high percentage of pattern matching etc.





**Gunner Olszewski** The fan favorite Bemidji State product signed with the Steelers in free agency. He provided depth for the Steelers as a receiving threat and special teams ace. Ultimately with how good PIT is at turning out WRs I dont see him having a bigger role in the offense and wish he stayed in NE.





**Ted Karras** Signed with the fighting Joe Burrows up in Cincinatti to play center. He is a fantastic player and I hope he and Joe Burrow bring home the Lombardi next year if we can't.





**Jakob Johnson** signed with the Raiders after the offensive brain trust decided to eschew the fullback position in 2022. We missed his lead blocking tremendously-our gap scheme runs suffered immensely- but nowhere as bad as our zone runs. On zone schemes we were absolutely dreadful- surprise surprise.





**Brandon Bolden­** The longtime special teams ace went with Jakob to join Josh McDaniels and his team as their third down back.  We dont talk about the ending to this year's Las Vegas game though.





**Shaq Mason-** Our longtime guard wound up going to Tampa Bay and playing in Tom Bradys penultimate season. Shaq was the bright spot in the Buccaneers offensive line which struggled immensely to run the football- resulting in several thousands of dollars worth of tablets being destroyed.

Not abysmal, but unacceptable. The team has worsened in nearly every category. Our only improvement, with fumbles, is negligible. (The team had 10 last season and 9 this season.)





Unfortunately, with respect to the work that Patricia put in for New England as a DC, he has not done any favors for his reputation around the league as a HC or as an OC. Nepotism is maybe the one major criticism I hold for Bill when it comes to this team, but no reason to dwell, this weird interim moment following the departure of Josh McDaniels is over.





Hopefully the coaching staff has had enough time to figure out what is best for the offense overall, and have found their man in Bill O Brien. Bringing the offensive output of this team back up to speed is of the utmost priority.





*Note: There isnt an easy way to find a league-wide ranking system for Pressures, but New England had 104 in 2021 v. 110 in 2022.*

**QUARTERBACKS**





| Quarterback Comparison | Mac Jones 2021 | Mac Jones 2022 | Bailey Zappe 2022 |

|Passer Rating|92.5|84.8|100.9|








Mac Jones had a difficult sophomore season under new (and now previous) OC Mat Patricia. Some of this can be attributed to missing time from a high-ankle sprain and poor coaching, but with Bailey Zappes strong play during his absence, the minute details are secondary in nature. 





Any major, impulsive decisions on this front would be myopic at this point, but as we all know, the NFL stands for not for long. Success at the position is all that mattersregardless of who sits in the drivers seat.  








I have included both QBR &amp; QB Rating as it is a debatable topic. I personally prefer QBR and what it takes into consideration. It helps highlight Macs slight edge over Zappe, even if the rookies 4 games look flashier at first glance. An in-depth comparison of QBR vs. QB Rating [can be found here.](https://thedatajocks.com/passer-rating-qbr/)








In the end, its important to contextualize this seasons performances. Sophomore slumps are common in the league. Defenses get a chance to have tape on your tendencies and when you experience a change at OC every season, its hard to build a solid foundation. Last, but not least, Zappes four games were against [some of the worst defenses in the league.](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/opp.htm#team_stats::none) 








Considering Mac has a rapport with Bill O Brienthey [reportedly worked together](https://www.patriots.com/news/report-patriots-to-reunite-with-bill-o-brien-as-new-offensive-coordinator) during the 2021 offseason in Alabamawe might see a return of the Mac and a competent offense. Only time will tell.

Our Achilles heel. Not a single receiver eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark and only one of the listed top-five eclipsed 600 yards. Matt Patricias play calling was the antithesis of friendly for the receiving corp, but blame aside, New England has to turn it around. Wed be lying to ourselves if we said that he was the sole cause of the passing game woes. Hopefully Bill O Brien can revitalize the air attack and address any lingering issues from the year prior. With a performance like last seasons, the Pats can only go northward in terms of improvement.

Damien Harris and Rhamondre Stevenson have essentially flipped roles. With Harris struggling to stay healthy, and having his carries cut nearly in half [(202 in 2021 to 106 in 2022)](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3925347/damien-harris), Rhamondre took the helm as workhorse for the team. Despite some unusual antics (Raiders debacle anyone?) the young duo is within / entering their prime, and the team should have nothing to worry about on this front, barring injury.

The strength of this team, as it has been more often than not, for two decades.








In some instances, the team has become worse, in two areas specifically. Passing yards allowed and points-per-game; but I believe that is due to the complementary relationship that the offense and defense have. If your defenders are on the field more often than not, then cracks in their foundations begin to surface.








All-in-all, Matthew Judon has clearly been a worthwhile investment, and so have our draft choices for the last two years (Christian Barmore and Marcus Jones most notably). We continue to be a top 10 defense and hopefully improvements in other areas can lighten the weight of its responsibilities.

Special teams, while not traditionally seen as glamorous, is as important as anything else to Belichick. [Ask him yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk). 





While our yards-per-punt might seem abysmal at first glance, thats not a real indicator of the overall value of the special teams group. In all likelihood, it has very much to do with field position, and where the offense kicks from. Everything else has either improved, remained as is, or dropped to a non-significant degree. Our FG % could be seen as a large drop, but Folk only missed five of his 37 field goal attempts, and all of his misses were 40-yards or further out.

#Roster Review  


*Written by ecupatsfan12*  





##Roster Review  


Note: This review excludes analysis of most of the 2023 Free Agent class.





##Quarterbacks





**Mac Jones, Bailey Zappe, Brian Hoyer** I dont foresee a change in the status quo of the quarterback room.  Mac is in his pivotal third year of his four year rookie contract, looking to rebuild from a disastrous 2022 marred by injury and coaching mishaps out of his hands. Mac is a Chad Pennington type player with good accuracy and great pocket presence albeit with a weaker arm. I see Mac rebounding strongly under Bill O Briens leadership and going for 4200 yards with 28 TD and 11 picks with the Patriots picking up his fifth year option.  





Bailey Zappe was our fifth round pick in 2022 out of Western Kentucky. I loved his quick release and his accuracy. He burst onto the scene for a few starts in place of Mac who was ailed by a bum ankle. He lit up the Cleveland Browns and Lions in his nascent starts causing several Patriot fans to get visions of Bledsoe Brady and proclamations that he was 23 years old and a hell of a quarterback. Mac returned to his starting job as it became apparent that Bailey also has a weak arm and limited ability to push the ball down field. Nonetheless, I am very confident in Bailey and see his future to be like Josh McCown- a journey man but a VERY good back up.





Brian Hoyer is a long tenured Patriot who has been around since the mid years of the Brady Belichick dynasty. He is likely transitioning to coaching after his playing career and is serving as an emergency/de facto QB coach to the young quarterbacks, a role in which he thrives in.


***


##Running Backs





**Rhamondre Stevenson** Rhamondre was our 4th round pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2021. Rhamondre burst out onto the scene in the back half of 2021 and 2022 and tallied his first 1000 yard season this year. His dazzling start even got the ever talkative Bill Belichick to say that he loved him and even going as far as to on the record compare him to his revered Lawrence Taylor. Rhamondre in my opinion is an exception to the rule of thumb to not pay running backs after their rookie contract. He has excellent hands out of the backfield, has great speed and runs hard. I look to Rhamondre to tally 1200 yards and 13 TD in a fantastic 2023 season.





**Pierre Strong**  Pierre was our fourth round pick out of South Dakota State this past year. Pierre primarily played on special teams this past year but got a handful of carries this year and flashed great speed. Pierre needs to work on his pass blocking and his running between the tackles. I look for Pierre to spell Rhamondre as our 3rd down back and score a handful of touchdowns this year.





**Lynn Bowden**  Bowden is a young journeyman who spent this past year on our practice squad. Hailing from the University of Kentucky where he played every skill position possible. Lynn has gotten limited playing time- but I look for him to maybe be elevated to play on Bills beloved special teams this year.





**JJ Taylor** JJ has been with the Patriots for three years as an UDFA from the 2020 class. JJ has primarily played on special teams with limited time in the backfield. I see JJ and Lynn competing to be the practice squad back and on special teams. I foresee the Patriots drafting 1 running back in the 4th round and I have targeted Keaton Mitchell from ECU and Tajae Spears out of Tulane as good fits.





**Kevin Harris**  The former Gamecock came to New England by way of the sixth round pick in the 2022 draft. Like his colleague Pierre Strong- Kevin got limited play time but showed flashes in spot duty. Kevin is a great downhill bruiser but lacks top end speed and ability to catch out of the backfield. I look to Kevin to take an expanded role in spelling Rhamondre in short yardage situations and duplicating Pierres production on the ground.





**Damien Harris** UFA


***


##Wide Receivers





**Kendrick Bourne** Coming to us in Bills free agency splurge of 2021 via San Francisco, Bourne flourished in his first year with Mac Jones and quickly became a fan favorite. Bourne- like most members of the offense- was puzzled over our coaching situation and drew the ire of the much maligned Matt Patricia. Kendrick spent part of the year effectively banished from the team and got limited play time in 2022 much to the chagrin of Patriots fans and Bob Kraft. I look for Bourne to have a fantastic 2023 season and rebuild that the dead weight of Matt Patricia and Joe Judge has been removed.





**Devante Parker**Coming to us via trade last year- Devante assumed the position of X receiver and the jersey number of Patriots legend Nkeal Harry. Devante has an outstanding ability to win jump balls and to box out defenders and was one of the few to gel with whomever was throwing him the ball. I look for Devante to have another great season this year.





**Tyquan Thornton** Our second round pick from last year, Tyquan was slowed by the Patricia and Judge clown car and suffered a shoulder injury in preseason. Tyquan returned midseason and flashed his outstanding speed and good route running. Tyquan did struggle with some drops but I think he will overcome this and be our deep threat this year. He must bulk up and get stronger to survive in the NFL long term.





**Nelson Agholor** UFA





**Jakobi Meyers** UFA





**Matthew Slater** Re-signed





**Ty Montgomery** The journeyman jack of all trades, Ty is listed as a receiver which he played at Stanford- he has bounced from RB to WR in the NFL. I see Ty likely getting the role of Matthew Slater of special teams stalwart if he does choose to retire.





**Raleigh Webb** We poached him via the Ravens practice squad this year and he is another hybrid type player. He was a standout at the Citadel and I know that Bill would like to use him as an H back type. I see him as a positionless player that spends time on the practice squad and active roster- he also played defense in college! He is currently listed at WR but that may change.





**Tre Nixon** Tre is our 7th round pick from the 2021 draft out of UCF. Tre has great speed but has not made much of an impact in his time in Foxboro. I see us adding 2 wideouts via FA or the draft and keeping Montgomery as a tweener. I dont see Nixon making the team in 2023.





**Scotty Washington** coming to us via the Bengals practice squad- an ex tight end. Ill eat part of a shoe if he makes the roster in Foxboro in 2023.





**LilJordan Humphrey** Picked up off Saints practice squad. Played in 6 games, dropped midseason.





*Draft Notes:* Possible adds via the draft are Jaxon Smith Njigba and Zay Flowers in the early rounds, and Rakim Jarrett or Trey Palmer in the later rounds.


***


##Tight Ends





**Hunter Henry** Hunter is a product of University of Arkansas and via the LA Chargers. We signed Hunter- Bills favorite tight end to a three year deal in 2021. Hunter has an outstanding connection with Mac and I look for him to rebound from our offensive woes in 2023.





**Jonnu Smith**  The FAU product also signed for us in 2021 but has struggled with the playbook and has been a major disappointment- he will likely be released prior to June 2nd when we can save some cap space.





**Matt Sokol** A journeyman who has spent stints on several NFL teams, I look for Sokol to be used as the 3rd tight end in 2023- reflected by the two year deal he signed in New England just recently.





*Draft notes:* Will Mallory out of Miami, Luke Schoonmaker out of MI, or Cade Stover out of OSU.


***


##Offensive Line





**Cole Strange** Cole came to us shocking the NFL world(and Sean McVay)  in the first round of the 2022 draft. The UC Chattanooga product had an outstanding Senior Bowl and wowed the Patriots staff. Cole did solid during his rookie year but needs to improve his pass blocking skills.





**Michael Onewenu** Onwenu was a 6th round pick out of Michigan from the 2020 NFL draft and has been our second biggest hit in that round from UM apart from a recently retired Florida Man. Onwenu has been a fantastic find on the OL for us.





**James Ferentz** UFA





**Yodny Cajuste** RFA





**Hayden Howerton** is our other guard available right now and we signed him off the Titans practice squad for a two year future deal. I look for him to be a nice depth piece. We might add one body from the XFL or USFL once their season ends.





**Tackle Andrew Stuebner** Andrew was another Michigan man from the 7th round of the 2022 class. Stubes will be a good swing tackle for us this year and is currently the only tackle on the roster. **Trent Brown** will likely be released and **Isaiah Wynn** likely not re-signed. I see the Patriots adding a tackle via free agency and adding two more in the draft.





**Connor McDermott** Re-signed for 2 years.





**Marcus Cannon** UFA





*Draft notes:* Dawand Jones- (Ohio State), Peter Skronski (NW), Jaedyn Duncan (Maryland) Matthew Bergeron (Syracuse) and McClendon Curtis (played next to Cole Strange at UTC).





**Center David Andrews** Andrews has been a stalwart since the mid 2010s in the Patriots interior. Andrews is likely in the twilight of his NFL career and will likely retire after the 2024 season.  We have two very young players in **Kody Russey** and **Chasen Hines** that will likely serve as depth in the meantime.





Bottom line is the offensive line will likely add another body at guard from the USFL/XFL-we will likely draft two tackles and add one via free agency. Offensive line needs some work. 


***


##Defensive Line 





**Davon Godchaux** Godchaux came to us via our division rival the Miami Dolphins in the 2021 offseason. Godchaux had a fantastic 2021 season but slumped in 2022 only registering 1.5 sacks on the year.





**Lawrence Guy** This longtime stalwart has been with the Patriots since 2017 and in the NFL since 2011. He has been a stalwart on the front lines for the last five years- however he is aging and the Patriots might cut him to save some cap prior to June 2nd.





**Christian Barmore** Barmore came to us in the second round of the 2021 NFL draft out of Alabama in the same round as his good friend Mac Jones. Christian has struggled a bit in Foxboro but is looking for his breakout third season on the team- with Guy possibly being released he will play a much bigger role this year.





**Sam Roberts** Our sixth round pick in last years draft from NW Missouri State made the team this past year albeit only dressing for a handful of games. He has a high motor and is a fan favorite and will likely play substantially more this year.





**Bill Murray, Jeremiah Pharms, and LaBryan Ray** are our reserve players at this position. I believe Ray will make the active roster and play a good bit this year- I dont see Murray making the team and I see Pharms being on the PS for the majority of the year.


***


##Defensive Ends





**Deatrich Wise** A fourth rounder out of the 2017 draft class- Wise had an outstanding year for the Patriots in 2022 racking up 7.5 sacks. Wise is our clear cut bandit end in our defense this year.





**Ronnie Perkins**  Perkins was a 3rd round pick in our 2021 draft class. He has seen little to no playing time due to injuries and depth. Perkins is in a do or die season in New England and will be playing with his hand in the dirt this year with the emergence of Josh Uche at rush end.





**DeMarcus Mitchell** Joined us as a UDFA out of Purdue in 2022 and got some playing time as a end and also as a stand up linebacker. I see Mitchell playing a similar but enhanced role in 2023.





*Draft notes:* Byron Young (Alabama) DJ Dale (Alabama) Jonah Tavai (SDSU) Jacob Slade (MSU)

##Linebackers and Defensive backs





Linebacker and defensive back is the strong point of the New England team- we have a very strong front with Josh Uche and Matthew Judon, plus our interior LBs of Anfernee Jennings and JaWhaun Bentley. The Jones Bois on the back end show promise along with Jalen Mills. While Devin McCourty might retire, we will probably re-sign Jabrill Peppers and play Adrian Phillips across from him. We will likely add a corner in FA and a safety via the draft.





Also: **Raekwon McMillan, Mack Wilson, Joejuan Williams**, UFA

Most of my games are played on wtc terrain 





I have tried dread lists and I have tried helverins hunter of beast aux lists. (these are not actually that good. Wounding on 5s and putting russ on a 4+ doesn't get much through).





Usually I also include some form of mw libby and 30 interceptors.  Not tried full msu yet 





A few of my biggest issues 





- I can't seem to see how I would outscore them. They get auto 15 abhor, seems to be auto 15 on in flex command and boots on the ground seems like minimum a 10 just for arriving at the table. Best I can do is try and 15 TA





- even with trying my best and having my opponent help me to try and obscure as much as possible, if I don't reserve the dreads I'm losing them t1. There isn't enough obscuring to stop 5 russ who can move and shoot from getting an angle if there's more than 1





- I've in all 5 games not had enough obscuring on wtc to have squads not die t1 to russ 





- tagging them in combat with interceptors do very little 





- edit: mortars cripple a squad a turn, and with a potential earthshaker kill a squad and make their points back easily. I'm on a clock before turn 5 to use them 





- I do no damage to russ even with Hob helverins (who would just die turn after they show themselves). A gk squad can do a lot in meleeb can't outright kill one





- karskin are gonna drop someone and kill multiple things

Here what I have in mind are straightforward dollars and cents losses that abusive families inflict on themselves because they want to maintain the illusion that they are always right and we couldn't possibly have useful feedback.





Two examples from my own life follow. Feel free to add your own.

Back when I was a college student, Mother told me her parents were buying a time share. I'd seen consumer warnings about time share investments and cautioned her, ready to supply references. She brushed that off with, ""They're getting a good one.""





[Morgan Freeman voice: ""They did not get a good one.""]





----





Before that while I was in high school, had been reading up on economics and found out about Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, back when that was open to new investors. Mentioned that to her and suggested she look into it. She never took the idea seriously.





----





Years before that while I was a kid, pulling weeds in Mother's yard was my chore. Maybe there's a separate conversation about whether it's age appropriate to task an eight-year-old with the entire responsibility for weed control in a suburban yard. Setting that aside, one day I noticed a strange weed. It looked like a sandspur but wasn't as sharp. 





So I stepped indoors to report it to Mom and asked her to have a look. She barely looked up from her book as she gave the brush-off.





This, I didn't learn until many years later, was the start of the yellow nutsedge infestation. Nutsedge is one of the worst weeds that can infest a yard, because a nutsedge weed a few inches tall can send down roots and tubers [nearly three feet deep in the soil](https://www.canr.msu.edu/weeds/extension/yellow-nutsedge). The tubers are the size of a raisin--not easy to find. Herbicides that kill the plant don't kill the tuber. So once nutsedge gets established, landscapers are known to deal with it by digging up and replacing several feet of topsoil.





Mother was always thinking about resalability of her house: she refused to paint the walls any color than white and she refused to install wall mounted shelving because those changes might make the house harder to sell. Meanwhile during the next twenty years nutsedge took over her yard. Any intelligent buyer would reduce the offer by the cost of a major landscaping project if they made an offer at all.





It wouldn't be surprising if she let the whole thing get so bad just because I'm the one who first pulled up a nutsedge to show her and suggested it might be a problem.

Folks,





We all know that the 2A is currently under a massive attack (great band, btw) in the state of Michigan, and right now, it is absolutely critical that lawmakers and the general public hear our voices. That being said, the amount of traction I've seen to try and counter these efforts has been minimal. GLGR has said they will file motion for recall elections for anyone who votes yes which is a solid response, but we need to turn out in mass to voice our disapproval of these bills in the first place.





I've also seen a few attempts at organizing an actual protest that have not produced any fruit as of yet. To that end, I'm going to take it upon myself to organize a peaceful protest and follow through with it.





Therefore, in the same manner that the MSU students did a short while ago,  I propose that gun owners stage a similar demonstration on **Saturday, March 11th at 12:00pm** at the state capitol, a la what happened in Virginia to actual success.





If you decide to come to this event, please observe these simple guidelines, as we need to present ourselves properly:





* Do not engage in any form of violence or harassment of others, especially if they don't agree with our position.


* If carrying, please be smart, sensible, and follow all applicable laws.


* Please dress appropriately. Business casual is fine. Political garb from either side just weakens our message (that message being that the 2A is for everyone; leave the ""Unite for a better future"" shirts or ""MAGA"" hats at home.)


* Do not engage in conversation with journalists. If you are asked questions by the media, your response should go along the lines of ""I am a concerned citizen who has shown up to defend my rights. All partisan actions or items here are not in association with what is being protested, and I do not affiliate myself with any political ideologies being raised here, and have no further comment.""


* Do not engage in political discussion that is off-topic (**anything** not related to the 2A)


* Do not discuss fringe issues (Covid, election fraud, etc.)


* Do not bring signs or imagery that can be used to paint 2A supporters in a negative light. Including but not limited to, Confederate flags, swastikas, punisher skulls, pirate flags,  encouraging violence etc.


* Invariably, bad actors will most likely be present. If you are asked about any of these issues, say something to the effect of: ""This peaceful protest is in support of Michigan citizens second  amendment rights and that is all. All partisan actions or items here are not in association with what is being protested, and I do not affiliate myself with any political ideologies being raised here.""


* Do not obstruct traffic. The plaza in front of, and sidewalks around the capitol building are legally protected protest areas in the state of Michigan. Obstructing traffic is illegal. To that end, do not engage in any unlawful behavior at all.


* Discourage anyone from engaging in any of the above prohibited behavior





We need to make our voices heard, and we absolutely need to support the GLGR if and when it comes to recall elections to get these dangerous legislators away from our rights.

"2023-02-22",1677098636,"Reflections on teaching the day after at Michigan State University","I am a split-position faculty+staff member at MSU. I thought I would write some reflections to share here about my own experiences returning to campus and teaching after the February 13th shooting on our campus. These reflections are purely my own. I want to emphasize that everyone has different reactions and processes traumatic events or injustice in their own way, and my experiences may not resonate with others. 





\-Going back to work.





The reason I went back to work is because I care about and value my students - as otherwise, the job is absolutely not worth it. They are wonderful human beings, compassionate, gracious, kind, smart, and young activists. I am not expressing bland positivity here  I dont particularly like many students, but the ones I'm privileged to work with have values and goals that I think are important for our community and world. They are what make the job worth it, and seeing them in class is what is keeping me going. Their response and strength has been incredible. 





\-We dont have time to process and respond to one injustice/trauma before getting overwhelmed with another.





From the pandemic, to the façade of a return to normalcy, to continuing racial injustice in the country, to a literal insurrection at our nations Capitol, to worsening economic conditions virtually everywhere, to ever-increasing catastrophe from climate change, it feels like a barrage of trauma and injustice that leaves us with no time to process or rebuild before yet another occurs. At MSU, over the past few years weve had the community trauma from the Nassar sexual abuse (plus just last month we got a public report that highlighted how sexual violence is a continuing issue here particularly for vulnerable groups), multiple high-profile incidents of racial bias and harassment, our president leaving last semester during another controversy, and now this mass shooting. Fuck this neverending shit. 





\-The burden from university leadership is constantly shifted to the frontline faculty/staff workers.





In the days following the shooting, university leadership has given speeches and held events, and some of what theyve said is thoughtful, but my own perception is that the focus has been too much on protecting the brand/identity of the university. 





However, in terms of the university response about going forward, there has not been much specific guidance. Students are promised grace and flexibility as the semester continues from their faculty, and they have moved all classes out of the buildings that saw gunshots. But as faculty, weve been given little direction as to how to accommodate this grace and flexibility. The response reminds me so much of COVID-19, where the burden of work was shifted to the frontline workers, the faculty and staff who keep the university and classes running. It feels like we are left to figure it out for what the response will be. Weve had events about teaching the day after an event like this and they have been helpful for processing how to return to the classroom and talk to students, but that is only one segment of rebuilding for this semester and beyond.





The university-wide email to faculty told us You should feel confident in adjusting syllabus expectations as needed. The university response  Just update your syllabus!  reflects the disconnect between administration, and the people who teach and support students. 





This is highlighted by the fact (as some posts have noted on this sub) that some faculty have been incredibly insensitive in returning right to content, exams, and requirements for attendance. I already knew this from working with some such faculty, but some of them lost a sense of compassion somewhere in their lives, probably during their PhD when it was beaten out of them. Academia is overflowing with bullying, abuse, presumed meritocracy, and detachment from reality, and during events like this, it shows.





\-The numbness and sense of inevitability of injustice - yet the need for activism and disruptive protest





With the rate of mass shooting in the US, I always viewed it as a distinct possibility that one would happen near me, and have thought about it at some point almost every time Ive taught a class. I also teach politically-charged topics, and have viewed being targeted as a distinct possibility. 





Stand at a busy intersection, and you will likely inevitably see an accident. Live in the US, you may eventually experience a shooting. It does not make it any less horrifying or scary, but this reality has left me with a sense of numbness, like this was unsurprising  when this should be shocking, terrifying, and surprising, because it (should) rarely ever happen, like in so many other places where this is in fact a rarity. 





I am massively in favor of gun control and my ideal would be to live in a place with few guns, in addition to a robust social support network including universal healthcare, workers' rights, labor unions, and high pay for teachers/mental health workers/childcare workers/elderly workers, and all the other truly essential jobs that create the fabric of our of society. 





I think what brings me the most anger is the amount of people who rush to the defense of guns/gun ownership no matter the frequency and scale of the violence caused by them in the US  particularly in a state like Michigan where it is part of the shitty culture here. Part of my life goal is to prevent and undo the damage such people, policies, and laws create - as well as to highlight in my teaching and advocacy on campus that overwhelming research shows that gun control works. Fuck your guns. Our lives matter more.

**Why Bork'An?** \- Bork""An offers up what I consider the most toolbox kit of the overall Tau Septs that gives ultimate flexibility. Additional durability from mid to light arms fire, additional 4"" range, and ignoring invuls every now and then is massively clutch when you just need something to happen.





**HQ Slots**





Coldstar Commander - Pretty straightforward Precision of the Hunter with some personal modifications. High Output Burst, Thermonuetronic Projector, and Fusion. I generally save my 2CP experimental weaponry stratagem for the fusion on this guy, as PotH makes it much more reliable to get that ignore invul fusion through, mainly to assassinate characters. Onager gauntlet shreds heavy infantry thats so common in the meta and gives another phase to interact in. 





Ethereal - Probably the most straight line power of the list. Humble stave for 2 invocations of FnP 5+++ and extra CP every turn. Exemplar of Mont'Ka goes here so I can fire and forget my Commander if needed and the Crisis don't lose re-rolls to wound. 





**Troops Slot**





Kroot **-** They do kroot things, could you ask for anything more? Generally standing on points and doing infantry based secondaries or tertiaries. 





Breachers - I almost always strategic reserve these bad boys. Bork'An lets them get a 12"" range on their close tier band of guns, allowing them to obliterate shit from strategic and Breach &amp; Clear with a markerlight setup. 





**Elites Slots**





XV8 Crisis Suits - 5x Plasma, 5x Cyclic, 5x Burst. Extremely Versatile platform allowing you to always have good targets and decent range with 22"" on the shorter range guns. Gets to advance 18"" and shoot, use Dynamic Offensive on them as needed with the 2nd CP from the Ethereal. I pack a shit ton of drones so that unit is an absolute bitch to chew through. Stimm Injectors because it's such a clutch hotfix to being in a bad situation. 





Firesight Marksman - I always want to take this unit out of my army, but every weekend Im reminded how useful this model is. They basically never die because of character protection and the stealth field. Deploy her in a piece of terrain that can see 2-3 objectives and you can leave her there all game, lighting things up for 3-4 turns with Ohrtus Lantern and redeploys with Exemplar of Kauyon.





**Fast Attack**





Kroot Hounds - Ol' Reliable for move blocking, snagging objectives, and keeping those pesky world eaters at bay turn 1. You want to be running minimum 3x4's





Vespids - These dudes are insane for their 12ppm price tag. Their guns alone pickup twice their value in game. Deep strike ability is premium and they move 14""! Great units for Retrieve Battlefield Data and dish out a punch in a pinch. 





Tetras - Mobile markerlights on demand. They move 18"" so stick them in a central location and you'll always have markerlights when you need them. People avoid shooting them because they don't murder you themselves. 





**Heavy Support**





Hammerhead - Does hammerhead things. Try not to cry when you roll a 1 to wound and you have no CP.





Skyray - Deceptively high damage with markerlight utility. 22"" accelerator burst cannons pack some dakka, and 1Cp for frequency lock lets the Array shoot D3+1 seekers out of LoS. This thing has crazy base stats for 135pt base and 10 for accelerators.





Broadsides - a Controversial unit for many, but I find them to be my reliable firebase. No one wants to shoot them because they're tough as hell in cover so I find them surviving most games. Set them in a spot that can see 2-3 objectives and hurl smart missiles and railguns their way. Multi-Tracker upgrade lets the smart missiles makeup for the -1 to hit out of LoS and nukes small infantry like gaurd, cultists, or orks. Also multi tracker railguns into large units of Custodes is just big LuL's.

**Secondaries**





This is probably the most important part of your gameplan and will vary on your mileage at events because Tau are stuck always taking 1 kill secondary. 





1. Decisive Action - a must take. Engage on all Fronts is inferior in every way and behind Enemy Lines takes a lot of commitment but can be screened out. I take this in 100% of my games


2. Banners, Retrieve Battlefield Data, or Aerospace Targeting Relays - Entirely dependent on matchup/mission. If you know you're going to have a non-interactive game or you're going to take a frontline assault Retrieve Battlefield Data is the way. 6 Objective missions like Tide of Conviction, Recover the Relics I take banners, and if I know I can achieve (2) 1st turn Aerospace markers and kill most of my opponent's army by turn 5 I will take Aerospace. Breaks. 


   1. An important note about Aerospace is that you start the action within 6"", don't have to end there. So if you start the action and string a unit along behind terrain, if they don't overkill you the unit will still complete it. 


3. The dreaded kill secondary - the most risky of all the options. Tau suffer from having to take one, so use your best judgement. Abhor the witch for Tsons and GK, Bring it down into Knights, Assasination for sisters and character heavy lists, no prisoners for heavy wounds, and grind for MSU. Be wary of grind if you know they can kill you too.   








**Mont'Ka or Kauyon?**





Kauyon is generally the better of the two, but part of being a good commander is recognizing when Mont'Ka is appropriate for when you can capitalize on an early game edge. I take Mont'Ka every 1 of 4 or 5 games. The math on Kauyon is insane, and you should be aiming to trade primary points or keep your opponent at 8's or ideally 4's on turns 1 and 2. Stage your army for turn 3  Kauyon, and start pressing the attack. 





Mont'Ka gameplay is to punish deployment mistakes and getting first turn, or if you know you wont survive until turn 3. I commonly take it into aggressive Ork players because the reroll 1s to wound and being able to get into position immediately with advancing and shooting the entire army means you can meet the DPS check aggressive Ork builds tend to dish out. 





**Other Things**





I saw a few questions in some threads last week that I can answer about my list. 





1. Why do you bring so many markerlights, it seems you cant even use them all? - Better to have 20 markerlight shots a turn than only have what you need. The Tetras are light vehicles and having so many means I can always have them without necessarily risking being out of position. Also not the first time my Tetra will roll triple 2's


2. 3x Broadsides, what? - Controversial unit these day it seems. I see that a lot of folks yeet shit into the broadsides turn 1 or underestimate how tough they are at 8 wounds with a 1+ in cover. The single shield drone in the unit means it's off putting to immediately shoot anti tank guns into them. That drone usually dies to savior protocols. Multi-tracker has been a uniquely useful piece of equipment. Combined with SMS it launches the lath into hilarious territory when Kauyon kicks in to killing chaff. If you can sit them in one spot and zone a few objectives all game, they are doing their job. You want them to make the tough choice of deciding to stand on an objective and get hit with Railguns, or dont. 


3. Onager Gauntlet Commander - Phase versatility is king in this game and movement wins games. The ability to delete a unit of like (3) 8-Bound in combat is an unparalleled high and is clutch for being able to free up shooting somewhere else. This commander gets absolute work done on units with no invul in combat and punking tanks in combat when shooting doesnt get the job done.

"2023-02-07",1675779468,"The Reddit Guide to MSU (warning: its pretty long (TWSS))","Ive seen a lot of people on this sub ask the same questions a lot. I figured, being a senior, I would do my part for the next generation of Spartans. Here is my list of things to help you succeed at MSU as a freshman, transfer, or alumni. Hope you enjoy:





Rule 1: it is strongly encouraged that a refresher driving course is taken before your time at MSU. The drivers here are world class and the course would help others to stay safe. Im sending a personal invitation to the girl driving her Mercedes in the STEM parking lot who looked right (and only right) while trying to make a right hand turn whilst finding a parking spot. Not a care in the world for anyone else driving that day. 





Rule 2: if you park somewhere you arent supposed to, or dont pay when required (no matter your feelings on the subject), and get in trouble via fine/towing& thats on you big dogs, not the towing company, not MSU, not the lord almighty Reggie Christ. 





Rule 3: Possibly the second most important rule on the list (see final rule for most important), ASK YOUR ADVISOR. Not Payton Thorne, not Tom Izzo, not your cousin Cletus&YOUR ADVISOR. It may be hard to believe but your advisor is there to give you advice on the many rigors of college, and if they dont know the answer, youre SOL. When in doubt about any concern, question, etc&ASK YOUR ADVISOR.





Rule 4: Going along with rule 4 is cut out the middle man. If you have a financial aid question, contact the financial aid office. Grade question? Office of the Registrar! Its amazing what we can accomplish when we logically ask the correct people for certain things.





Rule 5: Freshman: I promise you no one cares about you showing off your parents money except the jealous girls (if youre a girl) in your sorority. Dress like a bum like the rest of us, we all hate it here as it is we dont need you to make us more miserable.





Rule 6: no matter how confident your are, your pullout game is not that good. Wear a jimmy my boy. College is cheaper than a child, keep it that way. 





Rule 7: dont be a dick head to the people who help you around campus (or even off campus). The food staff (not limited to) is literally feeding you, be respectful of their time and effort.





Rule 8: Freshman: the campus is overall safe. There are a few tips and tricks to making it safer for you and your friend group: be a male, be white. Once you master these two things youre set! 





Rule 9: MSU (and all colleges really) are not the best for reporting cases of sexual assault. The sexual assault healthcare program is truly a great place and for anyone who has had this happen to them and can help you to make the best decision for you. Girls: dont be afraid to speak up. You dont have to go through that alone.





Rule 10: Trust me in this one&dont expect to walk from Lot 89 to the main areas of campus. You will be eaten by squirrels or ran over by a train if you try.





Rule 11: enjoy your time here. Meet new people, but never let your guard down. There  are sadly many sick people in this world (including your peers) who will walk all over you if given the chance. Dont give them the chance.





Rule 12: one thing I learned quickly in my 6 years of college is very rarely should you listen to the opinions of others when it comes to who is a bad (most likely the adjective horrible or terrible are used) professor. Most times the people who say they had a bad experience are the ones who are not applying themselves in class, or who think this is high school and their prof told them no to raising their 89.4 to a 90 when it clearly states no rounding in the syllabus.





Rule 14: before you ask your professor a silly ass question, READ THE SYLLABUS. 99.99% of the time the answer you seek is in there. To go along with this, never start an email/conversation with I know it say *blank* in the syllabus, but& Just FYI it says *blank* in the syllabus for a reason, so dont ask.





Rule 15: if youre sick, stay home. College is already  a cesspool of disease and illness, dont bring your known germs into the classroom and get everyone sick. Communicate with your professors and 7-8/10 times they wont care that you missed class. To go with this (and anyone familiar with puke girl on the 2023 snap story), if youre constantly sick please go see a doctor. Listen and be respectful of their time and services even if you have to wait a long time. This is a shot at puke girl (sorry!) but NEVER let your STEM/nursing friends treat you. Just go see a doctor. 





Rule 16: guys, respect the women. Youre not impressing anyone. 





AND FINALLY, for all of the (international) freshman who have a 9.47 GPA, 12795 SAT, started an orphanage for disadvantaged children, cured cancer, and solved world hunger by inventing a self sustaining floating farm&Rule 17: yes youll more than likely get into the honors college.





For anyone that made it this far I hope you enjoyed my list of tips, tricks, and rules. I think this could be a fun thing to keep adding to so feel free to comment your own rules! I think its obvious, but satire and sarcasm are always welcome on this post. Maybe indicate so we dont confuse the freshmen too much :)","msu",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/10w2xjj/the_reddit_guide_to_msu_warning_its_pretty_long/",2023-02-07 14:17:48

"2023-02-18",1676730936,"My FI Mindset is also my Health Superpower","Boiling it down, all it takes is a few simple rules to get FI.  Spend less than you earn, put the savings into good investments, get a portfolio of about 25x your annual expenses.  What if I just boiled good health down to a few rules and actually stuck to them too?  I could get better off than 97% of people (made up statistic) and be reaping huge benefits.  Its totally achievable; why not take action?  Thats the tldr.





#Preamble





First up, this is a bit of a long post so Im breaking it into sections so people can jump about to what they want.  Im on a bit of a tangent here but I swear it all ties back to FI so I hope you stick with me.  Secondly, Im just a random person on reddit with no credentials so Im going to be linking out to a whole bunch of sources when making any claims.  You can check them out for yourself.  Thirdly, any advice I give is only my own advice to myself.  So take my advice with a grain assault and if something works a bit differently for you then Id like to hear your take on things too.





#How remarkably similar Health and FI are





Everyone is looking for a quick and easy fix.  People seem to get most of their advice from influencers or advertising rather than sticking to tried and true methods.  Everybody is jumping on fads and hype trains.  The average person is mostly unaware and really not in a great state.  It seems overwhelmingly complicated from the outside.  The government is dropping the ball at helping people with this and corporations are stepping in.  Doing the wrong thing gets you short term pleasure at the cost of long term wellbeing.  Life is more expensive if you dont have it.  The only thing that really works is effort and discipline over a sustained time.  It all boils down to good habits and a few simple rules.  Once you build the habit it basically runs on autopilot.  Gains compound as the years go by. Having it unlocks more potential for you to achieve bigger and better things.





Are the above sentences talking about money or health?  Well, both.  Its amazing to me how much the story is exactly the same between the two spaces for all intensive purposes.  Its a bit of a revelation I had after I hit the boring middle financially and looked to do new things that werent boring.  I sought to own my health the way I owned my money and realized the two had so much in common.  I have no doubt that you, being on /r/financialindependence are fully capable of absolutely owning your health just like youve owned your money.  Its worth it.





Blah blah blah.  Take care of your health: weve heard it a bajillion times for years.  Very boring  But what if I actually did it: really followed the rules?  Like how I actually followed those great personal finance rules (assuming, since youre here).  What if I didnt think those health rules were so out of touch, the same way so many think personal finance rules are out of touch? 





#Why Bother?





Since were on FI, Ill mention: being in good health can save you sooo much money.  I can get FI sooner.  Healthcare is hella expensive.  Insurance is hella expensive.  Your body is truly priceless, so if you do it wrong the bills get insane.  Also, getting healthy is cheap!  Healthy food is cheap (more on this later), exercise is cheap (more on this later), and there is another more powerful and deeper thing that saves the most money of all (suspense!).





Outside of money, its amazing to see how much of a difference is easily possible.  Take a look at the pie chart of causes of premature death in the west. (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm)  Its pretty incredible.  Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, respiratory disease.  Right from the gecko you can see like 75% of premature death is related to lifestyle factors.  Now, you could still get unlucky but you have the power to take almost 75% of your tickets in the Death Raffle (starring Jason Statham) off the table.  Something will still get you eventually but you can probably make sure you get 75+ good years!





OK its not all about just being alive, what about quality of life?  Its pretty close to the same.  75ish% of chronic diseases are tied to lifestyle factors and often quite preventable. Why dont we just nip all those chronic diseases and deaths in the butt? You can live longer AND better.  





And thats just talking about avoiding disadvantages.  Im sure you can list a few advantages like looking better, having more energy, being able to conquer greater physical challenges, and being happier.  This was ultimately what I was after: feeling good and the capability to do the activities I want to do for decades to come.





#Well, what are the simple health rules?





This is a bit off the FI topic so skip if you need to. Theres bound to be some controversy here (always is) but I am posting backup sources.  





#1 Get enough sleep


#2 Get enough exercise


#3 Eat good





Details below.





**1  Get at least 8 hours of sleep.**





Primarily, you just have to actually give yourself full amount of time every night.  But if you have trouble with sleep quality there are [a few tips]( https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-habits) to try.





[Why sleep?]( https://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb21759528__Smatthew%20walker%20why%20we%20sleep__Orightresult__U__X2?lang=eng&amp;suite=def) Ever get a cold after an all nighter?  Its not a coincidence.  [Your immune system needs sleep. ](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/work-hour-training-for-nurses/longhours/mod2/05.html)  Your immune system also fights cancerous cells and inflammation and respiratory viruses, which it sucks at when you dont sleep.  [Sleep also produces the human growth hormone]( https://www.nulifeinstitute.com/blog/what-is-the-link-between-human-growth-hormone-and-sleep) that lets you turn protein into muscle.  You can eat all the protein and work out all you want but if you dont sleep itll still mostly get turned into fat.  [Sleep is obviously important for the brain too!]( https://www.brainandlife.org/articles/how-sleep-protects-the-brain/)  Energy, memory, cognition, mood (happiness).  I hate to be the bear of bad news but [even if you can power through with caffeine, youre missing out on a ton of benefits by not sleeping enough.]( https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2021/caffeine-and-sleep)





**2 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes vigorous.  Strength training twice per week, and a bit of stretching.**  (At least) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an6LKlx3JH8) (https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf)





Strong heart, strong bones, strong muscles, good endorphins (happiness), anti-injury, anti-frailty, do more, go farther.  Why does everyone have back pain these days?  Mostly because weak backs and inflexibility sets us up for failure.  





Theres lots of different exercise programs out there, and many of them are pretty good.  P90X, starting strength, pilates, 0-5k, personal trainers, laps in the pool, zumba, spin, lots of good options (and bad ones too, unfortunately).  If you have some specific goals like muscle building, weight loss, six pack abs, Olympic racewalking records, the splits, or becoming alpha, you can tailor things to you.  Just get started because you can't fix your body with duck tape later.  But start with rule #2 as the baseline and you cant go wrong.





**3  Diet: (a) Half your food should be fruit/vegetables (b) carbs should be unrefined (c) lean towards plant proteins.** 


(https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) 


(https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/healthy-eating-plate)





These rules work for me.  What does not work for me is tracking food (counting servings, calories, macros, vitamins, minerals, or whatever else.  Its too tedious.) and this is more actionable for me than Mediterraneanness (is this avocado Mediterranean enough?  What about this sushi?). This is the anti-cancer, anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-diabetes, anti-oxidant, anti-inflamatory, anti-hypertension, anti-obesity, anti-tooth decay, high protein, low saturated fat, high vitamin, high mineral, low confusion, low hassle diet for forever.





This is also the scientific consensus.  Your influencer might like keto better but scientists like this.  





Why these food rules?





(a)	You can do a whole lot with just this rule.  It almost speaks for itself.  Practically every vegetable is a superfood in its own right and if superfoods are half your diet you are already killing it.  Vegetables are no contest the best nutrient/calorie out there.  Theyre so filling they make it hard to overeat (thus calorie counting, which is a real pain in the ass, irrelevant) and so nutritious you dont really need to count vitamins by default.





(b)	Carbs are the villain du jour for a while now.  Carbs are fine, good even, yall are just eating the crappy ones.  Sugar and white flour, but [especially sugar]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM&amp;t).  Carbs like oatmeal, quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice, barley, chia  these arent the Carbs youre looking for, Joe Rogan.  High in [fiber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtnTuTX4L24&amp;t), nutrients, more filling, less calories, less boom-bust blood sugar.  So much goodness and lots of energy (you have to fuel Rule #2, remember).  This rule was maybe the trickiest for me, because sugar is hidden in so many foods I thought were healthy (yogurt, granola, cheerios, almond milk, pasta sauce, protein bars, salad (dressing), health drinks, bread, and with the sauces that sneak onto everything).





(c)	Im not saying go vegan.  I am saying cut back on [processed meat (a group 1 carcinogen, the same group as smoking), and red meat (group 2A carcinogen)]( https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat), cheese (like meat, just so much [saturated fat]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwSMgZYAaZU&amp;t)) and add in more lentils, beans, and nuts.  [Lentils]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/172421/nutrients) and [beans]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/747444/nutrients) have more protein per calorie (and per dollar too) than [ground beef]( https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/746779/nutrients) .  [They are just super good for you](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart/), vitamins minerals fiber and so on.  There are some hardliners who say veganism is the healthiest diet, some say pesco-vegetarian, some say were all lactose intolerant, nobody can agree about eggs.  The jury/science is still out on a few things but either way the scientific consensus is that the West is eating too much animal products for its own good.








(d)	What? There was no rule (d) listed above.  Well this is a bonus rule.  Rule (d) is that rules were meant to be broken.  Any diet that doesnt let you eat cake on your own birthday is stupid.  If you really fully follow a,b, and c even just like 80% of meals, then your diet is so damn good it basically wont matter if you have some treats on occasion.  This diet is for your whole life, not for yo-yo boom and bust.





You can add or adjust rules to fit your personal goals, but in my opinion this is the baseline to start from.  Less meat, cheese, and sugar - more vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes.  So simple. Its not rocket appliances.  I think its pretty hard to argue with that, but people will.





#But how does this help me be FI?





Numerous ways.  Less medical expenses is obvious.  But you also get more years and healthier years to work (or not work) which gives you bonus time to become more wealthy.  Costs go down AND earning can go up: you are getting two birds stoned at once.





And eating healthy is WAY cheap.  Oatmeal, quinoa, peas, beans, lentils, tomatoes, bananas, apples, squash, carrots, cabbage, brown flour, brown rice, peanuts, potatoes, onions, yams, corn, beets.  All these might be like $1-2 per pound.  A whole days food might be like $5.  Way cheaper than fast and processed food and way healthier too.  People who say healthy food is expensive must not realize you dont need organic, or worse they might be buying ultraprocessed expensive dumb supplements, juices, bars, or shakes that probably have a load of sugar.





Exercise is cheap too.  A pair of runners and a trip to /r/bodyweightfitness can get you going.  Although you might want more, like some basic gear like a /r/homegym or a bike.  Exercise can be way cheaper than some other entertainment sources, like fancy electronics or hitting the bar or shopping on Amazon.  No exaggeration: in some cases, two pints at a pub will cost more than a month gym membership.  Commuting by foot power is way cheaper than a car.  It saves money in the short and long term.





But the real, most profound cost savings that I kept you in suspense about (not really) from the beginning is that good health makes you happy.  [Science shows](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being) that good health is a major factor in being happy.  Happy people arent as susceptible to advertising to fill the void in their life.  They dont need consumerist junk.  They dont need to scour amazon for joy or get expensive status symbols for validation.  They dont need to smoke or drink to take the edge off.  They arent cranky because they are tired and low on blood sugar.  Will following my rules make you happy?  No promises but science says it helps.





#How has this worked out for me, so far





Good actually.  Its been more than a year since I starting bringing these rules in and they are autopilot now.  If I eat fast food I actually get a bit of tummy discomfort now, so the rules are truly easier to stick with than not to.





My skin looks better.  I can see a bit of abs showing even though Im not trying for that.  Im looking trim while watching my cohort at work get fat (sorry yall, Id sugar coat it but im following Rule 2b).  Ive made gains with weights and my resting heart rate is down to 54 bpm.  I have pretty good energy levels for an old guy.





And Im saving money like crazy.  My food costs like $60 per week.  I have no health issues to pay for.  I have a  $1,000 home gym which is now free entertainment. And love my surfing and biking and hiking which is also close to free.





And Im happier.  Im so much better at dealing with stress at work.  My body just feels good most of the time, which spills over into my mood and so I just mentally feel good.  I like people more and have been socializing a bit better.  I didnt used to be like this.  I used to be tired and stiff, cranky and stressed.  It's not always perfect but it's better than before.





What else is there to say?  Honestly, I just recommend giving it a shot.

"2023-02-15",1676465799,"Why Horny on Main Is Not Inclusive","**Why Horny on Main Is Not Inclusive**





Sigmarxism was put together to be an inclusive space for everyone. It's a library, it's a common area, it's your hopefully unproblematic local gaming club. We want everyone to feel welcome here.





The most common excuse we get for horny on main is that it's about sex positivity and the poster is only trying to complement that person/model/character.





**Sex Positivity**





For those that don't know;





""sex positivity says that sex can be a positive thing in a person's life. More than just that, though, says Texas-based sex educator Goody Howard, sex positivity is the idea that people should have space to embody, explore, and learn about their sexuality and gender without judgment or shame[.](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-positive-meaning#sex-positive-defined)""





We agree that this is a good thing, a necessary thing to undo the damage of puritan or religious attitudes, sexist stigmas that exist in society, and good as a whole for the whole LGB­T­QIA+ community.





**Horny on Main is not the Space for (sexuality)** **Sex Positivity**





Sigmarxism is simply not the space to explore your sexuality. Posting unironic horny, even if it's a variety of horny that goes against 'gender norms', is still objectifying someone or something, and possibly against a person's wishes. Or it's objectifying to someone who does not want to see it. It's off putting to someone who wants to look at minis, it alienates comrades. There have been studies that link the *unsolicited sexual objectification of people to negative mental health*. Sex positivity includes consent. When people joined this subreddit they did not sign up for these posts or comments.





Let's look at some of the comments we see reported and removed CW horny/casual r\*pe mention:





&gt;!\- ""uwu mommy dommy step on me""!&lt;





&gt;!This is reversing traditional gender roles, yet still objectifying her as a sexual object for the posters pleasure.!&lt;





&gt;!\- ""Death by snu snu""!&lt;





&gt;!This is still objectifying a someone as a sexual object.!&lt;





&gt;!\- ""Breeding rights are mine, yes-yes!""!&lt;





&gt;!Still objectifies afab and also casually pro-rape. Even within a context (there wasn't) of consensual or table top RP we don't want these comments here. This subreddit was made because we were tired of this garbage in other places!&lt;





When we remove a post, we're not judging you or your sexuality on a personal level, we're annoyed you're breaking community rules, alienating other posters and repeatedly doing so will end up with a ban.





Before you post, ask yourself if you are objectifying anything, anyone, a group of people, a gender, a race, or a body type with your comments. If you are, then don't post that here to the sub with 30k+ users. If you really really feel like you need your opinion known, maybe you have a tight friend group where that's acceptable, or go to an other appropriate subreddit/twitter/tumblr/dating app for this.





**Gender**





The definition of sex positivity includes gender as part of an individuals exploration and discovery.  On this subreddit we actively encourage any discussion about it with everyone, with engagement with table top settings or lore books, character backstories, character relationships or pride flag painting schemes.





**Nudity**





We have from the beginning allowed models posted that have nudity or semi nudity. It's not an inherent sexual thing to show a nude model.  Comments that engage with western cultural stigmas and sexualize the nudity will be removed. We simply ask that if you post a nude mini you use some discretion; is it only nude or is it in a sexually suggestive pose or has sexualized iconography? If it's the latter, don't post it. Use your judgement and discretion. We require that you use the NSFW tag on nude or semi nude models. Posting something in the title about it is helpful.





**Ironic and funny**





Once in a great while we allow some discussion that parodies some aspect, or riffs on a topic in an ironic way. These are difficult to define in a clear way. An element of satire must be clear. These posts don't punch down. The posts still don't get extremely explicit. Often these mock the extremely unironically horny. These have always been up to community reporting / mod discretion and the posts must be tagged with a NSFW.





As mods, we've seen an uptick in *unironic horny posts* in the last few months. Please, don't confuse the sexuality part of sex positivity with inclusiveness in a main sub. Keep horny posts to appropriate spaces and not here.

"2023-02-14",1676383028,"Please give this a read this morning.","Good morning, fellow Spartans.





As my flair suggests, Im an educator and as sad as it is to say, Ive had a lot of training on events like these. In fact, most of my educational training these last few years is trauma informed. Thats not to say Im an expert at all - just to say I wanted to share some of my insight as we process the events of last night.





What many of you are likely feeling this morning, and last night is called trauma, and your trauma is real. Some individuals have debated the gravity of this event compared to others, but that does very little to help the conversation. There was likely a moment where you felt out of control, deliberating anxiety, fearful for your friends, family, community members, or yourself. These feelings are real, these feelings are valid, and these feelings are likely not over in the waking hours. You may also feel like you are fine now, but then confused later when anxiety surprises you suddenly.





Address these feelings, in whatever way you need to. Some of us need to vent, some need to be alone, and some are touch and go as emotions are still high. Take controlled breaths, go to the gym, stay outside in the warm sun, or inside near a window. Read a book, play some games, call friends or family, try a new recipe, go out to lunch - do whatever you need to take care of you.





Try to avoid taking care of others until you are sure that your headspace is clear. As they say on airplanes, put on your own oxygen mask before attempting to assist others.





Id love for this thread to remain a place for Spartans to talk through their emotions, share social emotional wellness resources, or to just listen. Whatever you need, remember - your are cared for, your are loved, and you are safe.





Im here if anyone needs anything, and knowing our other mods - theyre likely here for you as well, in whatever capacity they can.

Was he legally able to buy a gun?  If so, why?  If not, how did he get one?





Of note, I also found multiple traffic offenses including being a repeat offender for driving without a license.  But the main issue is the weapons violation.





In short, this is NOT a ""law abiding gun owner.""  But we knew that.





And, of course, the shootings took place in a ""Gun Free Zone"" as it's now come out that the shootings were inside the buildings and we have at least one photo of him entering a building while drawing the handgun.  One can't legally carry inside an MSU building even if holding a valid permit.





**UPDATE** [Found his prison record](https://mdocweb.state.mi.us/otis2/otis2profile.aspx?mdocNumber=606937)





Apparently it the charge was lowered to a misdemeanor - ~~meaning he was NOT a prohibited possessor for THIS charge.~~





**EDIT**  ~~He was a prohibited possessor. The misdemeanor charge has a potential penalty of ""not more than 2 years"" which means that he's a prohibited possessor under 18 USC 922(d)(1)~~





**EDIT Again**





I forgot about 18 USC 921(20)(b) which says





&gt; crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year does not include





&gt; any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.





So, he MAY not have been a prohibited possessor.  The statute lists the crime he was convicted of as a ""misdemeanor.""  However, I'm finding anomalies in MI law such that a ""misdemeanor"" with a penalty of up to 2 years is also a ""Class G Felony.""  If the evaluation is on the statute saying ""misdemeanor"" on it then 921(20)(b) means he is **NOT** a prohibited possessor.  But if it's considered a ""felony"" then 921(20)(b) doesn't come into play and the crime is punishable by a sentence exceeding one year so he is a prohibited possessor.





At this point I'm thoroughly confused; but leaning towards him not being a prohibited possessor on the concealed without a permit charge that he plead guilty to.","gunpolitics",73,"https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1126k3x/msu_shooter_prior_arrest_felony_concealed_carry/",2023-02-14 14:23:07

I feel helpless knowing that I'm sending my child off everyday and worry for when he starts school. Will I have to buy him a Kevlar backpack? Will he not come home one day? I saw an article today that today is the 5 years anniversary of Parkland.

Compared to some of the other schools, Michigan State was a bit late in the game in terms of full integration of their football team. However, it started post WWII with legendary coach Biggie Munn who started recruiting black players in the South to play for Michigan State and it helped them win National Championships in 1951 and 1952. Duffy Daugherty was the successor and continued this practice of recruiting black players and eventually fully integrated the team in the 1960s, and eventually claimed national championships in 1965 and 1966, being the first fully integrated team to win natties in the process. 





As a black Spartan, I'm proud at what my alma mater was able to do in terms of helping progress civil rights in such an era and wanted to share it with y'all.

###Preface





The 2022 edition of the Detroit Lions was an archetype of a feel-good movie. No, they didn't win the championship. No, they didn't even make the playoffs. But the story of the season, as it played out, was one of near-ultimate disaster followed by one of the best redemption arcs you'll ever witness.

* Detroit Lions featured in the preseason edition of HBO's *Hard Knocks*, granting an early look at the culture and team chemistry HC Dan Campbell (aka MCDC throughout the rest of this) is building in Allen Park.


* Preseason - most pundits figured the Lions good for between 5-6 wins; anything more than that would put the rebuild *well* ahead of schedule. In my Offseason Review, I was more optimistic, putting the O/U for the season at 7.5 wins, and predicting that they would finish 8-9 on the season.





### Week-by-Week Season Review





[Week 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alUxGeJTAl4): **PHI 38**|35 DET





* The first game of the year was a microcosm of the entire first half of the season. Absolutely electric offense, especially in the second half, but a defense that just couldn't stop or even slow down the opposing team for much of the game. This was also the first indication to the entire league this season that Jalen Hurts *might* be good. Of course, since he did it against the Lions, many people discounted his performance.





[Week 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJZWECsE2d0): WAS 27|**36 DET**





* The Lions get their first win of the season, and this time they didn't have to reach double-digit losses to do so! Detroit coasted to an easy 22-0 halftime lead, but even when the Commanders cut the gap to 8 pts early in the 4th qtr, this game never felt like the Lions let it get out of their control. Rookie DE Aidan Hutchinson scored three sacks in the win.


* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_tmuvagbC8)





[Week 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PAFAYNi3mA): DET 24|**28 MIN**





* This was one of a handful of games the team *really* wanted back, especially late in the season as the playoff race ramped up. The teams started by trading missed FGs before the Lions scored TDs on consecutive drives to go up 14-0. By halftime, however, Minnesota had caught up. The Lions' defense actually did okay in the 3rd qtr, bookending a 3-and-out and a fumble recovery around another missed FG for the Vikings. Meanwhile, Goff and the Lions regained a 10 point lead with two solid drives...then fell flat for much of the rest of the half. Some questionable clock and play decisions by MCDC allowed Minnesota to escape with the win - and force the Lions to the only division loss they would suffer the entire season.





[Week 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TEk17Jbaiw): **SEA 48**|45 DET





* If the Lions wanted the Vikings matchup back by the end of the season, they had to be *furious* at themselves for losing this one, considering the head-to-head loss in Week 4 would ultimately be the tiebreaker that would keep the team from the postseason. The Lions' defense absolutely collapsed, never once forcing Seattle to punt. In addition, two key turnovers directly led to 14 points for the Seahawks - a lost fumble in the 2nd qtr and a pick-six to open the second half. Detroit fought to close it up afterwards, helped by a SEA missed FG, but the gap was just too much to overcome. By the end of this game, the Lions were in the top 3 for the offense and absolutely dead last on defense.





[Week 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STecW2M_Yk0): DET 0|**29 NE**





* A completely forgettable game. Injuries to the offense bogged down an offense that had previously been playing lights out. In the second half, the Lions, facing a deep hole, went 0-4 on 4th down. Bailey Zappe did everything the Pats asked him to, meanwhile, going 17/21 for 188 yds, 1 TD, and 1 INT.





Week 6: ---BYE---





[Week 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qttnwr6YQt0): DET 6|**24 DAL**





* Coupled with Week 5's loss, this stretch of two weeks around a bye felt like a nightmare as a fan. 6 pts total to two emminently beatable teams, and in this game Dak Prescott in his first game of the regular season took advantage of the Lions' *five* combined turnovers, including a rare fumble by Jamaal Williams at the Cowboys' 1 yard line. 





[Week 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMdGq5ovdNw): **MIA 31**|27 DET





* The defense, once again, asked the offense to not make a single mistake. This game was actually in Detroit's control early one; up 21-7 at one point, and still up by 10 at the break, Tua just had his way most of the game. Even with that, though, the Lions still had a chance - it all came down to one call. 4th and 1 from the MIA 35 the offense *obviously*...threw it deep and missed. Hey, make it and you're the hero. Don't, and well... The team was now 1-6 and there were beginning to be rumblings about how long it would take to fire MCDC, and how the organization had botched yet another rebuild.





[Week 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yk8Xdso0XE): GB 9|**15 DET**





* DB coach Aubrey Pleasant was let go during the week before this game, and in Allen Park, the team held a players-only ""get right"" meeting. It worked. Coupled with the return of several players from injury, the rest of the season saw a resurgence of hope, optimism, and most importantly, wins. First up: Aaron Rodgers and his Packers that were in a downward spiral of their own. In a game of bad (at the time) teams, Detroit was slightly less bad - critical were three interceptions - two by Kerby Joseph and one by Aidan Hutchinson, all deep in Lions' territory. Kudos to the defense for balling out and holding the Pack to single digits after getting *crushed* the entire year to that point.

[Week 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XX6l1P1h0I): **DET 31**|30 CHI





* Win #3 of the season came in dramatic fashion. A trip to Soldier Field looked like it was going to be a bitter one by the end of the 3rd qtr. Down 24-10, the Lions kicked it into overdrive. First, Swift scored one play after a CHI interception was wiped out by penalty. Two plays later, Jeff Okudah snagged a pass intended for Cole Kmet and jogged in 20 yards for the pick-six, and suddenly the game was tied. Justin Fields tried to win on his own, racing to a 67 yard TD that put the Bears back on top, but critically, they missed the PAT. Goff and the Lions responded by marching down the field and punctuating their second comeback of the game with - what else? - a 1 yd plunge by Jamaal Williams. PAT good, and the defense would finally make a crucial stand to finish the game out.

[Week 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZquLHM2ujI): **DET 31**|18 NYG





* The Giants came into this game 7-2 after playing well above expectations. The Lions came in 3-6 with wins over the so-so Commanders and two bad division rivals. None of that mattered, as Detroit held Saquon Barkley in check and cruised to an almost embarrasingly easy victory.

[Week 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hROU2VNy6Vk): **BUF 28**|25 DET





* This game will forever be remembered as the upset that could have happened, except that Goff underthrew an open DJ Chark, forcing the Lions to kick a FG and leave Josh Allen enough time to work his magic. LB James Houston did score a pair of sacks in his debut, showing the first flash of what would be an amazing story for him.





[Week 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2SJqlZR-SE): JAX 14|**40 DET**





* With a mini-bye under their belt, the Lions played very poor hosts indeed to Jacksonville. Finally, the *Lions* had a no-punt game (more specifically, they scored on all eight of their meaningful drives - no turnovers at all, and their ninth ""drive"" was a pair of kneeldowns), and this time, the defense actually kicked in a solid effort as well. This would be the Jags' final regular season loss, as JAX would go on to win the AFC South and squeak into the playoffs.

[Week 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLS2MuJ4rRs): MIN 23|**34 DET**





* Detroit scores yet another win that almost seemed too easy for observers. It took the team about a quarter to find their footing, but once they did, they just put the pedal to the metal and peeled away from the Vikes, getting revenge for the early-season loss in Minnesota. Notably, WR Jameson Williams caught a 41 yard bomb for his first reception - and first TD. Goff followed that up with a 48 yarder to DJ Chark, making up for the miscue against the Bills two weeks prior.

[Week 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHKQc3vTe5M): **DET 20**|17 NYJ





* After scoring just three wins (okay, and a tie) all season during the 2021 campaign, here the Lions put together their 2nd three-win streak in just seven games. Their second trip to the Meadowlands in five weeks was much tougher than the first, but a gutsy call on 4th and 1 allowed Goff and TE Brock Wright to be the heroes this time (see: Week 8) - Wright's rumbling touchdown after the catch was an instant sensation.


* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uwrJOl0Ho8)





[Week 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aILh26hthhk): DET 23|**37 CAR**





* By this point, there was plenty of talk that the Lions might *actually* sneak into the postseason. At 7-7 following their second-half surge, they still needed every possible victory - especially after WAS and NYG had their tie, negating DET's tiebreaker advantage over each. Unfortunately, this trip to Carolina occured in the middle of an extremely harsh cold snap that put an already bad field into nearly impossible shape. Several complaints, including one by the NFLPA, were made following the game, but by then Carolina had done what it needed to in order to remain in position in the NFC South.





[Week 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFMjujQwOKU): CHI 10|**41 DET**





* No heroics needed this time. Losses by every other team in the hunt (except for Green Bay) kept the Lions in the playoff mix, and they took care of business by easily destroying the Bears at home, scoring 31 unanswered points to end the game.


* [Locker Room Celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo5qUjapfBY)





[Week 18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gglsiPZeCnQ): **DET 20**|16 GB





* Just three teams remained, with two of them going head-to-head. Green Bay, on a resurgence of their own following their mid-season loss to Detroit, joined the Lions and the Seahawks as the only teams left fighting for one single playoff spot. The NFL decided to toss Green Bay a bone and flexed this matchup to prime time - if Seattle won the afternoon game, then Detroit would be eliminated before the final game of the season even kicked off. Of course, that's exactly what happened, as the usual referee shenanigans Lions fans know so well screwed the team over in a game they weren't even directly playing in. None of that mattered, though. Kerby Joseph picked off Aaron Rodgers for the third time this season, and on what may be Rodgers' last ever pass as a Packer. It was a glorious rewrite of a story that was tailor made for Green Bay to march into the playoffs - instead, the Lions got their first winning season in years and ended the season on a jubilant note, winning 8 of their final 10 games.

### High Points





* Ben Johnson's offense proving to be for real


* Kerby Joseph owning Aaron Rodgers


* Aidan Hutchinson proving the pre-draft hype


* Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jamaal Williams playing lights-out all season

* A winning fucking season!





### Low Points





* Defensive woes, especially early on, leading to...


* A 1-6 start to the season


* Clock and playcalling miscues costing the team wins early


* Injuries - none worse than S Tracey Walker going out for the season


* Seattle knocking off the Rams and pushing the Lions out of the playoffs





### Roster Review





(**Starter**)/(Notable backup)





|POSITION|PLAYER|


|:--:|:--|


|QB|**Jared Goff**|


||Nate Sudfeld|





* Jared Goff did everything asked of him and more. While he had some turnover issues early (including a few pick-sixes and a fumble leading to a scoop &amp; score), he finished the final 9 games of the season with 0 INTs - and his current streak of 324 passes without an INT is already the 5th-longest in NFL history. His knock is that he's a system-QB, and not one to put a team on his back, but the difference is that he is *executing* that system at a level that no one would have believed two seasons ago when he was traded along with a raft of picks for Matthew Stafford. He has earned his spot on the team as QB1, and his rapport with Ben Johnson is off the charts.


* What *is* needed is something the Lions haven't had for a long, long time - a quality backup that can be trusted to win games if Goff goes down. It is possible that the Lions take a QB at #18 just for insurance - and unlike last year, it wouldn't send the message of ""here's your replacement as soon as you lose your first game"".


* Regardless of draft or free agent signing (Nate Sudfeld is likely not returning), what the Lions need in a backup is a more mobile QB - if for no other reason than to give the defense something vaguely resembling a running/ dual-threat QB to practice against.

|LT|**Taylor Decker**|


|LG|**Jonah Jackson**|


|C|**Frank Ragnow**|


|RG|**Halapoulivaati Vaitai**|


|C/G|**Evan Brown**|


|RT|**Penei Sewell**|


|T|Dan Skipper|


|G|Logan Stenberg|





* The Lions' line, collectively, performed at a stellar level - and that includes Frank Ragnow who suffered through a foot injury for much of the season.


* Dan Skipper earned a special shout-out by MCDC in the locker room after the team's Week 2 win over Washington, and bounced around the line filling whatever gap was needed. 


* At the time of this writing, the entire starting line (except for Brown) is still under contract for 2023, but I would not be surprised to see Holmes begin to draft quality prospects to ensure continuity of the high level of play the line has shown recently.


* Hal Vaitai is considered a starting player, but was out for the entire season after hurting his back in preseason. Evan Brown did marvelously taking over the spot. I don't think Vaitai is still with the Lions this coming season - likely cap casualty.





|||


|:--:|:--|


|RB|**D'Andre Swift**|


|RB|**Jamaal Williams**|





* Both D'Andre Swift and Williams can be considered starters here; Swift was used more in longer-yardage situations, while Williams was *near*-automatic in short-yardage, must-have plays - including the inordinate number of times Detroit receivers ended up getting tackled *just* short of the goal line. Williams' 17 touchdowns broke Barry Sanders' single-season record, led the league in total rushing TDs, and came in second for total TDs for the season.


* Swift's season was more up-and-down through the year. An early injury seemed to affect his play-making ability through much of the second half, but he still showed grit and ability throughout, and his 8 TDs certainly came in handy.


* Looking ahead to the draft, Bijan routinely gets mocked to the Lions - if that *does* happen, he most likely replaces Swift. More realistically, a 3rd or 4th round pick could give the team the replacement it needs while allowing for a more impactful player elsewhere earlier on. No matter what happens though, I believe the Lions do as much as they can to sign Williams to another contract - he's expressed a desire to return, and retaining his leadership would be a genuine plus. If you think he just wants to cash in - take a look at his [postgame interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubeJwtsHlUE) after the season finale, and then tell me that again.

|:--:|:--|


|WR|**DJ Chark**|


|WR|**Amon-Ra St. Brown**|


|WR|Jameson Williams|


|WR|Josh Reynolds|





* It took some time for DJ Chark to live up to the billing and promise he showed when he was signed to a 1yr deal last offseason. Still, as the season went on, he showed an ability to click with Goff and serve as a long-range weapon. Chark has also shown a willingness to return, but with Jameson Williams getting a full offseason/ preseason to work with Goff, I think Chark will find a better deal elsewhere.


* Amon-Ra St. Brown, meanwhile, was electric in his return to the lineup. Just 6 TDs, but caught 106 passes for over 1100 yards on the season, and as he matures, should continue to provide a needed short-to-mid field outlet.


* Jameson Williams had been projected to return by the team's early bye week, but his rehab was taken *extremely* seriously by the team. As a result, his impact on the field was minimal, bvut his competitiveness was shown on the sideline the entire season.


* I don't know that the Lions, with so many other needs, will take a WR in the draft - but how free agency proceeds will go a long way towards determining the fate of this position for the team.





|||


|:--:|:--|


|TE|**Brock Wright**|


|TE|Shane Zylstra|


|TE|James Mitchell|





* After trading fan-favorite TJ Hockenson to rival Minnesota mid-season, his former teammates all took a step forward in production. Wright and Zylstra combined for 8 TDs between them (Zylstra with a 3-TD game against Carolina), and Mitchell showed some flash while still recovering from his prior ACL injury.


* It's possible the Lions go out and get a free agent here or spend a Day 3 pick on a prospect, just for depth and position-battle in training camp, but the position is *not* (despite how outside entities view it) a position of need at all for the team.





|||


|:--:|:--|


|DE|**Romeo Okwara**|


|DT|**Alim McNeill**|


|DT|**Isaiah Buggs**|


|DE|**Aidan Hutchinson**|


|DE|John Cominsky|


|DE|Levi Onwuzurike|


|DT|~~Michael Brockers~~|





* Aidan Hutchinson did a phenomenal job as a rookie EDGE rusher. Had Sauce Gardner not proved to be that rare cornerback who can come in and just shut *down* an entire side of the field as a rookie, Hutch might very well have walked off with RotY honors. He did win the fan voting for RotY, so it's not like his efforts went unrecognized.


* McNeill and Buggs both came up big in various moments this season, especially as the defense began to gel during the second half of the season.


* Romeo Okwara continued to be plagued by injury, and in his absence, John Cominsky provided a needed spark to help get both Hutchinson and, eventually, Houston free to menace the offensive backfield.


* This was not a defense that excelled against the run - so I fully expect the addition of a good, run-stopping DT to be acquired either through FA or, more likely, a Day 1/ Day 2 pick in the draft.


* Michael Brockers was released by the team in late February, adding more need to replenish the interior defensive line this offseason.





|||


|:--:|:--|


|LB|**Alex Anzalone**|


|LB|**Malcolm Rodriguez**|


|LB|James Houston|





* Anzalone improved *dramatically* after Aubrey Pleasant's departure. For the entire 2021 and first half of 2022, Anzalone looked lost, frequently playing out of position and on at least one instance this season, running directly away from where the play was developing. His presence in the locker room, however, keeps getting called out as nothing short of exceptional, and for a position the team doesn't value highly, it was worth keeping him around. His improvement in play towards the end of the season bodes well for his future in the league.


* Rookie Malcolm Rodriguez was an instant hit during *Hard Knocks*, and his early season performance was a bright spark in a defense that desperately needed one.


* The real surprise, though, was the shocking impact of James ""Da' Problem"" Houston. On Thanksgiving against Buffalo, Houston racked up a pair of sacks and a fumble recovery. That impact would carry through the rest of the season, as he would end up with 8 sacks in 6 games. While not useful against the run, his pass-rush will be an exciting aspect of the team's defensive play moving forward.


* The team has plenty of assets in LB behind these three, but I'd expect Detroit to see who is available during free agency. Perhaps, like last season, they find another late-round addition, but this position should not be considered a major need from the team's internal perspective this offseason (regardless of what the media may claim) - *unless* the team decides to move on from Anzalone.

|:--:|:--|


|CB|**Jeff Okudah**|


|CB|**Jerry Jacobs**|


|FS|**DeShon Elliott**|


|SS|**Kerby Joseph**|


|SS|**Tracey Walker**|


|CB|Will Harris|


|S|Ifeatu Melifonwu|





* The defensive backfield is, in my own opinion, the position group with the highest need for improvement. Jeff Okudah was decent, though not great, and Jerry Jacobs continues to excel when compared to his original status as an UDFA. DeShon Elliott and Kerby Joseph likewise performed okay overall, even after Walker's season-ending injury.


* Everyone here is serviceable, but like the WR group last year, both S and CB need new additions to come in and move the entire rest of the depth chart down one. I will forever curse Quinntricia for jettisoning Darius Slay - the Lions haven't had a top-flight cornerback since.

|K|**Michael Badgely**|


|P|**Jack Fox**|


|KR|**Justin Jackson**|


|PR|**Kalif Raymond**|





* Badgely came onto the team after ~~Riley Patterson~~ Austin Siebert failed early on and was released. (edit: credit to /u/eugene_rat_slap for the correction below! It was Patterson who was released in training camp.) It helped settle out the position, and Badgely finished the season 24/28 for FGs and 33/33 on PATs. However, his inability to boot from long-range led to the Lions needing to go for it on 4th down or try for short punts more than other teams. UofM K Jake Moody keeps getting mocked to the Lions late, and I wouldn't be upset to see that happen as a 6th or 7th round pick (regardless of my own status as an MSU fan).


* Jack Fox continues to excel, and should return for another season.


* Kalif Raymond earned a game ball for his punt return for TD against the Jets, and had quite a few great returns to help flip the field throughout the season.


* Justin Jackson quietly had a good KO return season, consistently getting decent field positions. Among all kick returners who fielded more than 8 returns, he ranked 9th in average return yards and 3rd in number of 20+yd returns. Not flashy, overall, but consistent.





### Coaching Staff Review





|TITLE|NAME|


|:--:|:--|


|HC|Dan Campbell|


|OC|Ben Johnson|


|DC|Aaron Glenn|





* This trio will return intact for the 2023 season, and has well earned that return. Both coordinators fielded head coaching interviews, with Johnson deciding to turn down the Panthers and the rest of the league early on, while Glenn returned for second interviews to the Cardinals and the Colts. Glenn did receive heat for the defense's failures early on, and it'll be interesting to see what he learns from that. That said, the defense's rebound after mid-season *is* a credit to his leadership.


* Dan Campbell and GM Brad Holmes are building a coaching roster full of prior players, bringing that on-field experience to the Xs and Os side of the field.

|Asst HC/ RB|Scottie Montgomery|


|QB|Mark Brunell|


|Asst QB|JT Barrett|


|Passing Game Coord|Tanner Engstrand|


|OL|Hank Fraley|


|WR|Antwaan Randle El|





* Duce Staley, the 2022 Asst HC/ RB Coach, departed for a similar position to the Panthers. In return, the team adds Scottie Montgomery to fill that void - coming most recently from the Colts. Tanner Engstrand moves up from TE coach and could be considered an OC prospect for as soon as the 2024 season, especially if Johnson decides to take head-coaching interviews more seriously than he did this offseason.

|:--:|:--|


|DL|~~Todd Walsh~~|


|LB|Kelvin Sheppard|


|Asst LB|Shaun Dion Hamilton|


|DB|Brian Duker|


|CB|Dre Bly|





* Duker is confirmed as Pleasant's replacement here, but will be working hand-in-hand with new addition Dre Bly. Hamilton, meanwhile, was a former player who was cut during training camp last year, and comes back for a second season wearing a headset.


* One interesting addition, especially given the team's recent stretch of seasons with horrible injury news, is the addition of a staff member fully devoted to player health: [Brett Fischer](https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2023/2/12/23596699/report-lions-hire-brett-fischer-as-director-of-player-health-and-performance), the team's new Director of Player Health and Performance. Coupled with Detroit's swap of artificial turf this offseason, I'm intrigued by what a season with relatively few season-ending ACLs might look like!


* Todd Walsh (DL coach) ended up departing the team in mid-Feb to join the Panthers in the same role. As of right now, Detroit's own coach roster page only has Cameron Davis as an Asst. DL Coach - no replacement for Walsh has been named as of yet.


* Not listed above, former head coach journeyman John Fox was hired at the end of February as a Senior Defensive Consultant.





### Free Agents Breakdown





I strongly encourage people to take a few minutes and read /u/boanerges_77 's writeup on free agency as part of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/10ej51r/lions_mock_offseason_i_the_way_too_early_version/). I'll simply drop the list of free agents here; please go read that post, as they do a better job of explaining everything *much* better than I ever could. 





(*Editor's note*: Bo77 ended up deleting their account while in the middle of an entire series of posts about the state of the Lions' position groups - sad times, but this person was a *fantastic* writer for the sub. In addition, they were the writer of this post for last offseason, and graciously allowed me this opportunity this season, so...if you're reading this, thanks Bo, and good luck in whatever you're doing out there!)

### Team Needs for FA &amp; Draft





Note: These are just my own projections, mixing my own assessment with how I've seen the team prioritize positions - your mileage may vary, and the team's own internal decisions on this are likely to be different than everyone else's, including my own. These are also listed in no particular order.

* As mentioned above, the secondary needs some serious upgrades. Along with that, a good run-stopping interior lineman (or *maybe* a run-focused linebacker) would help get the defense off the field in more short-yardage situations.


* On the offensive side, the team should look at beginning to draft new talent in the trenches, and also figure out where they're getting a quality backup QB from. After that, they start to take a look at the skill positions.





### Why Root for the Lions?





* **Culture**. This organization is building a core of quality players, both on and off the field. Jared Goff was the team's Walter Payton Man of the Year nominee, and well-deserved it was, but he wasn't the only one that could have been nominated. The team as a whole has been very involved with the community, both in the Detroit area as well as players' hometowns. The off-field shenanigans and distractions from other teams just don't exist in the same way for Detroit.


* **Identity**. From his very first press conference after being named Head Coach, Dan Campbell has made no bones about wanting to be a tough, gritty, hard-hitting team. No one can argue he hasn't done that. The ""next man up"" philosophy has been an absolute necessity as injuries both great and small have taken their toll.


* **Future outlook**. With their first winning record since the 2017 season, the team heads into the offseason with hope for the future. Even in the Caldwell era, with three playoff trips in four years, there was always this sense of ""when would the wheels fall off?"" Last season, people knew that the team needed not just a rebuild, but an absolute demolishing and reforming. This season just past, the team beat expectations for total wins, even after putting themselves in a major hole to start the season. Next year - at the very least the team will be expected to compete for their first-*ever* NFC North championship, and potentially much more.


* **Demise of SOL**. ""Same Ol' Lions"" has been a millstone of a moniker around the team's - and its fanbase's - collective neck for decades. 1 playoff win in the entire Super Bowl era, HoF careers for both Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson wasted (along with Matthew Stafford's time with the team), the curse of Bobby Layne - this team is opening the window to bring hope and glory to *generations* of fans. Join us - the long-suffering, the paper-bag wearers, the fanbase of ""just once before I die"" - as we cheer our team on to victory.
